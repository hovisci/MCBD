NOTE that authors do not consider this to be a substantial difference, use as evidence that eco-tourism is good for bd; See Survey 1. ; na; ""Scale of entire system"" is unclear given that it is not specified where the tourists are coming from. I chose intercontinental, but that was entirely a guess. 

Similarly, no idea how to deal with ""Number of countries involved"" when we don't know which countries the tourists are coming from. 

Number of time periods: Put 62 because that's the total number of surveys conducted.
