"1007","Effectiveness of protected areas for biodiversity conservation: mammal occupancy patterns in the iguacu national park, brazil","DA SILVA MARINA XAVIER;PAVIOLO AGUSTIN;TAMBOSI LEANDRO REVERBERI;PARDINI RENATA",2018,"Protected areas - widely recognized as the main strategy for biodiversity conservation - have greatly expanded, covering similar to 15% of the earth; however, we still lack detailed information on biodiversity to evaluate their effectiveness. This is particularly urgent for biodiversity hotspots where protected areas are islands within human modified landscapes. We focus on mammals of the iguacu national park - one of the most important parks in the atlantic forest hotspot - to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas in conserving biodiversity. We monitored 300 km(2) with 37 cameras traps during five years to assess if (1) species occupancy declined over time, and (2) if species occupancy/detectability are spatially associated with illegal hunting, proximity to tourism infrastructure and distance from the edge, estimating the proportion of the park where these negative effects are detected. Many species that are rare in most atlantic forest remnants presented high occupancy within the park, and no decline in occupancy was observed over time. However, the distribution of 11 species was spatially associated primarily with the distance from the edge and proximity to tourism infrastructure, resulting in a decline, across half of the park area, from 13 to 23% in occupancy and from 19 to 35% in detectability (values averaged among species). These negative effects should be even stronger on smaller protected areas, which are the majority in highly altered hotspots. Re-establishing and properly managing buffer zones and restricting tourism to localized areas are essential to ensure the effectiveness of protected areas for biodiversity conservation.","Mammals","Tourism","BRA","South America","1007_Mammals","Not significant or unclear"
"1040","Long-term trends in a northern gulf of mexico common bottlenose dolphin (tursiops truncatus) population in the wake of the deepwater horizon oil spill","BALMER B;MCDONALD T;HORNSBY F;ADAMS J;ALLEN J;BARLEYCORN A;CLARKE P;CUSH C;HONAKER A;MCHUGH K;SPEAKMAN T;WELLS R;SCHWACKE L",2018,"Bottlenose dolphins along the northern gulf of mexico continue to be impacted by numerous stressors including harmful algal blooms, infectious disease epizootics, and oil exposure following the deepwater horizon (dwh) oil spill. Studies to assess the potential impacts of the dwh oil spill on dolphins in the northern gulf of mexico were initiated as part of a natural resource damage assessment and included photographic-identification (photo id) surveys to determine abundance, density, and site fidelity in st. Joseph bay, florida (sjb). Although significant oiling did not occur in sjb, long-term data have been collected in this region to provide insight into population-level trends in abundance/density over time. Thus, sjb dolphins could serve as a reference for comparison to other dolphin populations exposed to dwh oiling. During 2005-2007, the results of photo id and telemetry surveys determined seasonal fluctuations in abundance and identified two different dolphin populations in sjb: residents sighted across multiple seasons and years (st. Joseph bay stock), and visitors that were present during the spring and fall and associated with a 2-3 fold increase in abundance (northern coastal stock). The goals for the current study were to compare dolphin abundance, density, and site fidelity, prior to (2005-2007), during (2010), and post-dwh (2011 and 2013) using photo-id surveys and a spatially explicit robust-design capture-recapture (serdcr) model. The data collected during and post-dwh paralleled previous research in that a low number of individuals with high site fidelity were sighted across seasons and years (st. Joseph bay stock), and abundance/density increased in the fall as a result of an influx of dolphins that were likely members of the northern coastal stock. However, june and august 2010 abundance (347; 193-498, 95% ci and 394; 288-534, 95% ci, respectively), density (dolphins/km(2)) (2.60; 1.36-3.70, 95% ci and 2.55; 1.89-3.29, 95% ci, respectively), and site fidelity patterns were more similar to previous years' spring and fall data, with high abundance estimates, increased dolphin density in coastal waters, and elevated numbers of individuals with low site fidelity in the sjb region. Factors that could have contributed to this increase in abundance include immigration of dolphins from adjacent estuaries, population growth within the st. Joseph bay stock, impacts from dwh oiling, and environmental and/or prey-based cues that influence movements of the northern coastal stock. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of long-term monitoring to assess impacts of current and future stressors on the dolphins in the northern gulf of mexico.","Mammals","Energy Transfer","USA","North America","1040_Mammals","Harmful"
"1270","Using a trait-based approach to measure the impact of dam closure in fish communities of a neotropical river","LIMA ANA C;SAYANDA DIOGO;AGOSTINHO CARLOS S;MACHADO ANA L;SOARES AMADEU M V M;MONAGHAN KIERAN A",2018,"Damming is one of the main causes of the global decline in freshwater biodiversity. Yet, many hydroelectric dams are being built (or planned) in the neotropics, where the high species diversity and lack of basic ecological knowledge provide a major obstacle to understanding the effects of this environmental change, which has been mostly described from the perspective of taxonomic change. However, this approach does not account for biological function. Trait-based analysis provides an alternative approach to bioassessment. We assessed the impact of dam closure on the functional structure of fish communities of a neotropical river by applying trait-based analyses to the response of individual traits aggregated at the assemblage level. Fish data were collected during three distinct time periods (1 year before, 1 year after and 5 years after dam closure), at eight sites located downstream of the dam, in the reservoir, transition zone and upstream. The results indicated that reproduction strategies (migration and parental care) and diet (detritivores) were the trait categories mostly affected by the dam, with the response of downstream assemblages differing from upstream of the dam. A trait-based analysis to the impact of damming on fish communities appears to be a promising approach using an initial descriptive analysis of individual traits and regression models of multiple traits that reflect species' adaptation to the new environment. This study provides both an alternative and complementary approach to taxonomic assessment of impacts from damming, contributing towards a more robust evaluation of the response of fish communities to dams.","Fish","Water Transfer;Energy Transfer","BRA","South America","1270_Fish","Changed"
"1299","Outdoor recreation causes effective habitat reduction in capercaillie tetrao urogallus: a major threat for geographically restricted populations","COPPES JOY;EHRLACHER JUDITH;THIEL DOMINIK;SUCHANT RUDI;BRAUNISCH VERONIKA",2017,"Outdoor recreation inflicts a wide array of impacts on individual animals, many of them reflected in the avoidance of disturbed areas. The scale and spatial extent, however, at which wildlife populations are affected, are mostly unclear. Particularly in geographically isolated populations, where restricted habitat availability may preclude a relocation to undisturbed areas, effective habitat reduction may remain underestimated or even unnoticed, when animals stay in disturbed areas and only show small-scale responses. Based on telemetry data, we investigated the spatial and seasonal effects of outdoor recreation - in relation to landscape and vegetation conditions - on western capercaillie tetrao urogallus, considering two scales, home range and within-home range habitat selection. We determined the distance-thresholds up to which recreation infrastructures were avoided and estimated the extent of affected habitat for the isolated black forest (southwestern germany) study population. While outdoor recreation did not affect home range selection, strong effects on habitat use within the home range were detected: distance to recreation infrastructure (hiking and cross-country skiing trails, ski pistes) was the main determinant of habitat selection in winter; in summer, mountain bike trails and hiker's restaurants were avoided up to an average distance of 145 m (ci: 60-1092 m). Around winter-infrastructure, relative avoidance was recorded up to 320 m (ci: 36-327 m), it was reduced, however, when dense understory provided visual cover. Of the entire population area, between 8-20% (summer) and 8-40% (winter) were affected by outdoor recreation, mainly in the high altitudes. Even without evident large-scale shifts in species distribution, local-scale avoidance of outdoor recreation can substantially contribute to effective habitat reduction. Based on our results we recommend a general reduction in recreation infrastructure density in key habitats, the establishment of undisturbed wildlife refuges with a diameter of at least 800 m, as well as enhancing visual protection by maintaining a strip of dense understory along trails.","Birds","Tourism","DEU","Europe","1299_Birds","Harmful"
"134","Effects of invasion at two trophic levels on diet, body condition, and population size structure of hawaiian red shrimp","DUDLEY BRUCE D;MACKENZIE RICHARD A;SAKIHARA TROY S;RINEY MICHAEL H;OSTERTAG REBECCA",2017,"We examined the degree to which invasion by non-native, nitrogen (n)-fixing riparian trees and poeciliid fish alters diet of a common grazer/detritivore in brackish ponds on the dry coast of hawai. I island. Because this shrimp, halocaridina rubra ('opae'ula), displays a preference for autotrophic components of epilithon, we hypothesized that tree canopy would reduce their body condition and abundance, but that this would be moderated by nutrient quality of leaf litter (high-quality, non-native, nitrogen-fixing tree vs. Low-quality, endemic non-nitrogen-fixing tree). We hypothesized that poeciliid invasion would reduce population size and body condition of h. Rubra by direct predation and by inducing reductions in feeding rate. Analysis of stable isotopes (delta d, delta c-13, and delta n-15) showed that direct consumption of leaf litter detritus supplemented h. Rubra diet in ponds with canopy cover. In addition, epilithon in ponds with canopy cover was isotopically more similar to leaf litter than epilithon in ponds without canopy cover, and our evidence suggests this may be due to contributions of allochthonous nutrient sources to epilithon assemblages. However, canopy cover, whether native or invasive, did not decrease epilithon growth rates and had little effect on shrimp body condition or population size. In contrast, poeciliid invasion reduced daylight grazing on the benthos, and caused a reduction in body condition among larger shrimp. Our results indicate that primary succession by invasive trees may shift food web linkages in these ponds from autotrophic to heterotrophic support, without negative impacts on native grazer/detritivore communities. We suggest that poeciliid invasions have sub-lethal effects on h. Rubra as well as their direct predation effects, with potential long-term implications for the ecosystem function of anchialine ponds and other coastal systems.","Invertebrates","Species Dispersal","USA","North America","134_Invertebrates","Not significant or unclear"

A critical determinant of success in achieving these goals is the financing that is committed to maintaining biodiversity(6-9); however, financing decisions are hindered by considerable uncertainty over the likely impact of any conservation investment(6-9). For greater effectiveness, we need an evidence-based model(10-12) that shows how conservation spending quantitatively reduces the rate of biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a model, and empirically quantify how conservation investment between 1996 and 2008 reduced biodiversity loss in 109 countries (signatories to the convention on biological diversity and sustainable development goals), by a median average of 29% per country. We also show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be predicted with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances the effects of conservation investment against those of economic, agricultural and population growth (human development pressures)(13-18). Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the improvement that any proposed biodiversity budget would achieve under various scenarios of human development pressure, and then compare these forecasts to any chosen policy target. We find that the impact of spending decreases as human development pressures grow, which implies that funding may need to increase over time. The model offers a flexible tool for balancing the sustainable development goals of human development and maintaining biodiversity, by predicting the dynamic changes in conservation finance that will be needed as human development proceeds.","Multiple","Investment","GLO","Global","1349_Multiple","Beneficial"

"1488","Impacts of oil palm expansion on avian biodiversity in a neotropical natural savanna","LOPEZ-RICAURTE LINA;EDWARDS DAVID P;ROMERO-RODRIGUEZ NABHI;GILROY JAMES J",2017,"The consequences of converting tropical rainforest to oil palm are well-documented, but the impacts of oil palm conversion on natural savanna landscapes remain little-known. Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared.","Birds","Trade","COL","South America","1488_Birds","Harmful"

"1565","Subtle differences in birds detected between organic and nonorganic farms in saskatchewan prairie parklands by farm pair and bird functional group","KIRK DAVID ANTHONY;LINDSAY KATHRYN E FREEMARK",2017,"Organic farming may be more beneficial to biodiversity than nonorganic farming but the comparison is often confounded by regional within-farm and landscape differences. We compared breeding bird species composition and abundance on 10 farm pairs of each type matched at the site level for land cover in the prairie parklands of saskatchewan, canada in 1990. Land cover was measured around bird point counts at two extents; 'site' (6.3 ha area) and 'field' (16.3 ha area). We pooled species into functional groups; linear mixed models showed no significant differences between farm types for species richness but that all birds, migratory birds using crops and aerial insectivores were more abundant on organic farms. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated that farm type did not have a significant overall effect on compositional similarity but that pairwise differences existed between about half of the farm pairs (the direction of differences in beta diversity was not consistent between organic and nonorganic fauns according to tests for the homogeneity of multivariate dispersions). Farm-pair differences were more pronounced for all birds and for migratory bird species using crops, migratory birds consuming grains and ground feeders, but not grassland birds. Nmds ordinations suggested that there was more variation in species composition and abundance on organic farms than nonorganic ones but the difference was not significant. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbitda) was used to examine the main drivers of bird species composition and abundance and to see which extent was most important; land cover at the field extent was more important than land cover at the site extent or the farming practices measured. The most important field-extent land cover was the amount of native grassland, woodland (including shelterbelts) and wetlands. After controlling for significant field-extent land cover, seed treatment, herbicide use, and number of passes were significant. At the site extent, greater non-crop heterogeneity had a significantly positive effect on abundance and species richness of several groups (e.g., grassland birds, migratory granivores, ground feeders, ground nesters) but a negative effect on richness of woodland birds and abundance of aerial insectivores. Relationships with crop heterogeneity were mostly negative and non-significant. Overall land cover heterogeneity at the site level was positively related to the richness of grassland birds. In contrast at the field extent, non-crop heterogeneity did not have any significant effects on the richness and abundance of any functional group. Crop heterogeneity had a significantly negative effect on aerial insectivore richness and abundance. In the early 1990s, differences in birds between organic and nonorganic farms in saskatchewan were evident but subtle and variable among farms, and apparently most related to land cover-bird assemblage interactions/relationships.","Birds","Trade;Knowledge Transfer","CAN","North America","1565_Birds","Not significant or unclear"
"1590","How is wood-based pellet production affecting forest conditions in the southeastern united states?","DALE VIRGINIA H;PARISH ESTHER;KLINE KEITH L;TOBIN EMMA",2017,"Exports of woody pellets from the southeastern united states (us) for european power plants have expanded since 2009, leading to concerns about major negative environmental effects. Us exports of wood pellets have grown from essentially nothing in 2008 to 4.6 million metric tons in 2015, with 99% of us pellets being shipped to europe. To examine effects of this recent expansion of the pellet industry on forest conditions, we use us department of agriculture forest service (usfs) forest inventory and analysis (fia) annual survey data for 2002-2014 to analyze changes in timberland trends since 2009 for two fuelsheds supplying pellets to the ports of chesapeake, virginia, and savannah, georgia. This analysis reveals that the chesapeake fuelshed had significant increases in acreage of large trees and harvestable carbon after 2009. Furthermore, the timberland volume within plantations increased in the chesapeake fuelshed after 2009. The savannah fuelshed had significant increases in volume, areas with large trees, and all carbon pools after 2008. Increases in carbon in live trees for the chesapeake fuelshed and all carbon pools for the savannah fuelshed for the years before and after 2009 provide empirical support to prior estimates that production of wood-based pellets in the southeast us can enhance greenhouse gas sequestration. Both fuelsheds retained more naturally regenerating stands than plantations; however the number of standing dead trees increased within naturally regenerating stands and declined within plantations (but only significantly for the savannah fuelshed). While the decrease in the number of standing dead trees per hectare for the savannah fuelshed plantations after 2009 warrants investigation into its effects on biodiversity, others have recommended thinning and hardwood mid-story control within pine plantations to provide habitat for regionally declining bird species, which is consistent with use of biomass for energy and reducing the risk of fire. While all energy use affects the environment, these results show that benefits accrue when sustainable forest management provides wood pellets for energy that keep fossil fuel in the ground. By contrast urbanization is the greatest cause of forest loss in the se us. It is essential to consistently monitor and assess forest conditions to assess changes, for exports of wood-based pellets for the southern us are expected to grow. Even though use of pellets for energy has more than doubled, the pellet industry constitutes < 1% of us forest products by weight. Therefore, any recent changes, in se us forest conditions are more likely related to the 2008 declines in the housing market. Continued analysis of annual fia data using the methods outlined in this manuscript provides a scientifically valid approach for ongoing assessment. (C) 2017 elsevier b.v.

In this connection, we assessed the state of the bat colonies in relation to tourist abundance and behaviour in the devetashka cave, bulgaria. The cave is of european importance for bat conservation and houses more than 10,000 bats in the summer. However, during the weekends it is subject to an enormous tourist flow consisting of 500-1000 persons per day. In order to estimate the tourist factor, the number of people, whether flashlights and photoflashes were used and the maximum noise produced were recorded during observation sessions. Bat abundance, activity and adult and juvenile mortality were recorded in order to track the condition of the bat colonies. We discovered a strong positive relationship between the number of visitors to the cave and bat mortality (r = 0.569, p < 0.05).

Although a few species are imperiled as a result of the wildlife trade, the lack of field studies makes it difficult to gauge how serious a threat it is to biodiversity. We used data on changes in bird abundances across space and time and information from trapper interviews to evaluate the effects of trapping wild birds for the pet trade in sumatra, indonesia. To analyze changes in bird abundance over time, we used data gathered over 14 years of repeated bird surveys in a 900-ha forest in southern sumatra. In northern sumatra, we surveyed birds along a gradient of trapping accessibility, from the edge of roads to 5 km into the forest interior. We interviewed 49 bird trappers in northern sumatra to learn which species they targeted and how far they went into the forest to trap. We used prices from sumatran bird markets as a proxy for demand and, therefore, trapping pressure. Market price was a significant predictor of species declines over time in southern sumatra (e.g., given a market price increase of approximately $50, the log change in abundance per year decreased by 0.06 on average). This result indicates a link between the market-based pet trade and community-wide species declines. In northern sumatra, price and change in abundance were not related to remoteness (distance from the nearest road). However, based on our field surveys, high-value species were rare or absent across this region. The median maximum distance trappers went into the forest each day was 5.0 km. This suggests that trapping has depleted bird populations across our remoteness gradient. We found that less than half of sumatra's remaining forests are >5 km from a major road. Our results suggest that trapping for the pet trade threatens birds in sumatra. Given the popularity of pet birds across southeast asia, additional studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and magnitude of the threat posed by the pet trade.","Birds","Trade","IDN","Asia","1799_Birds","Mixed"

We propose a novel biodiversity footprint index based on bird extinction risks to evaluate the effects of global wood production and trade on biodiversity. Using 536 endangered bird species threatened by wood harvesting and logging, we calculated the ""quasi-extinction"" probabilities, that is, the probabilities that population sizes become lower than an extinction threshold after habitat loss based on initial population sizes and forest habitat loss rates. We then used bilateral wood trade data to link the biodiversity impacts in wood exporters to wood importers. We found that if recent trends in forest cover loss continue until 2100, bird species in brazil would be the most rapidly and heavily affected by wood production and trade, followed by those in indonesia; these two countries alone would account for about half of all global bird extinctions. Large-scale wood importers (i.e., china, japan, and the united states) significantly elevate overseas extinction risks and, simultaneously, reduce domestic impacts, indicating a heavy responsibility of these countries for global biodiversity loss. We also conducted a scenario analysis, which showed that the total projected number of extinct species would not decrease if each country produced the amount of wood materials necessary to meet current consumption levels. This is because bird extinction risks in tropical wood importers, such as mexico and the philippines, as well as japan and china will increase if these countries increase domestic wood production. Our biodiversity footprint index is useful to identify countries whose bird species are highly affected by wood production and trade, and to quantify the role of wood trade in bird species extinctions. Additional scenario analyses are needed to establish effective patterns of wood production and consumption for bird biodiversity conservation. (C) 2016 elsevier ltd.

Here, the implications of using different indicators in the calculation of biodiversity footprints caused by land use were analyzed. Footprints refer to the impacts related to the net consumption in a region. We calculated biodiversity footprints for 140 regions in the world with an environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output (eemrio) model. The eemrio links economic activities from the global trade analysis project (gtap) database with land use and four indicators of biodiversity loss. We included three alpha diversity indicators (loss of mean species abundance, relative abundance and relative species richness) and one indicator of gamma diversity (vulnerability-weighted relative species richness loss). While the three alpha diversity indicators reflect local diversity within a site, the gamma diversity indicator captures global diversity by weighting regional species richness with species' extinction vulnerability in a region. We found that the three alpha diversity footprints show close alignment (r(s) > 0.93), while there was limited convergence between alpha and gamma diversity footprints (r(s) < 0.22). The alpha diversity indicators identified a diverse set of regions with high per capita consumption-based biodiversity footprints across the globe, while the gamma diversity indicator emphasized human consumption patterns threatening particularly tropical biodiversity. Although all footprints are positively related to rising household expenditure, this relationship was weaker and highly uncertain for the gamma diversity footprints. The alpha-based footprints also showed a negative relationship with population density, while the gamma-based footprint was not related to population density. Our results highlight the relevance of including both alpha and gamma diversity indicators in land-based biodiversity footprint calculations.","Multiple","Trade","GLO","Global","227_Multiple","Harmful"

Southern african countries make an important contribution to elephant conservation and could soon become the last stronghold of elephant conservation in africa. While the ecological factors affecting elephant distribution and densities have extensively been accounted for, there is a need to understand which socioeconomic factors affect elephant numbers in order to prevent conflict over limited space and resources with humans. We used elephant count data from aerial surveys for seven years in a generalized linear model, which accounted for temporal correlation, to investigate the effect of six socioeconomic and ecological variables on the number of elephant at the country level in the greater mapungubwe transfrontier conservation area (gmtfca). Important factors in predicting elephant numbers were the proportion of total land surface under cultivation, human population density and the number of tourists visiting the country. Specifically, elephant numbers were higher where the proportion of total land surface under cultivation was the lowest; where population density was the lowest and where tourist numbers had increased over the years. Our results confirm that human disturbance is affecting elephant numbers, but highlight that the benefits provided by ecotourism could help enhance elephant conservation. While future studies should include larger areas and more detailed data at the site level, we stress that the development of coordinated legislation and policies to improve land-use planning are needed to reduce the impact of increasing human populations and agriculture on elephant.","Mammals","Tourism","BWA;ZAF;ZWE","Africa","2284_Mammals","Beneficial"

This heavily forested region contains important breeding habitat for many neotropical migratory songbirds, including several species of conservation concern. Our goal'was to examine effects of unconventional gas development on forest habitat and breeding songbirds at a predominantly forested site from 2008 to 2015. Construction of gas well pads and infrastructure (e.g., roads, pipelines) contributed to an overall 4.5% loss in forest cover at the site, a 12.4% loss in core forest, and a 51.7%,increase in forest edge density. We evaluated the relationship between land-cover metrics and species richness within three avian guilds: forest interior, early-successional, and synanthropic, in addition to abundances of 21 focal species. Land-cover impacts were evaluated at two spatial extents: a point-level within 100-m and 500-m buffers of each avian survey station, and a landscape-level across the study area (4326 ha). Although we observed variability in species-specific responses, we found distinct trends in long-term response among the three avian guilds. Forest-interior guild richness declined at all points across the site and at points impacted within 100 m by shale gas but did not change at unimpacted points. Early-successional and synanthropic guild richness increased at all points and at impacted points. Our results suggest that shale gas development has the potential to fragment regional forests and alter avian communities, and that efforts to minimize new development in core forests will reduce negative impacts to forest dependent species.

What shifts in plant traits occur along gradients of tourism intensity? What recommendations regarding the sustainable management of baltic sea beaches can be proposed? Location: southern baltic sea beaches in germany. Methods: in this study, the species composition of vascular plants on beaches with differing accessibility to tourists was analysed at the southwest baltic sea coast. In total, 894 vegetation plots were evaluated in order to determine vegetation changes along the sea-inland gradient due to different levels of human accessibility at beaches. Releves were conducted as repeated transects from the beach ridge to the shore. Shifts in vegetation characteristics due to different levels of tourism access were analysed at the level of plant communities and plant species traits. Results: species richness did not differ significantly between the levels of accessibility. Vegetation cover significantly increased with distance to the shore and was highest in the upper shore area of closed beaches (52.0 +/- 2.7%). Corresponding to the increase in beach access, we observed an increase in ruderal species and a decrease in typical beach species of the vegetation class honckenyo-elymetea. Tourism access and distance to the shoreline had a decisive influence on the distribution of plants with selected plant traits. In particular, at accessible sites, a loss of plants with leaves having high scleromorphy was recorded. Conclusions: increased beach access results in a loss of typical beach plant species. Changes in vegetation characteristics are considered to alter the function of the beach ecosystem. Based on these results, we derived spatially differentiated management measures for excluding the most sensitive beach areas from tourism.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Tourism","DEU","Europe","2606_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Changed"

"2642","Impacts of aquaculture on fish biodiversity in the freshwater lake laguna de bay, philippines","CUVIN-ARALAR MARIA LOURDES A",2016,"Laguna de bay is the largest inland water body in the philippines, being used predominantly for aquaculture and open water fisheries. Aquaculture in the lake began decades ago, with many changes in the lake ecosystem having occurred since that time. Most dominant species for fish culture are introduced species. Other invasive species were also introduced to the lake as escapees from land-based aquaculture facilities. This study was conducted to monitor fish diversity in two adjacent, but distinctly different, sites in the lake, namely an open fishery area (ofs), with no adjacent aquaculture structures, and an aquaculture site (aqs), with cages for the culture of various commodities. Fish traps were installed at both sites, with the traps being sampled at least every 2weeks from april 2013 to february 2015. The results of pairwise t-tests indicated significantly higher shannon-wiener diversity index (h), evenness (j), simpson's similarity index (d) and species richness (s) in ofs than in aqs. In terms of total catch per day, significantly greater fish biomass were obtained from aqs than from ofs. Introduced aquaculture species had a mean dominance of 83% and 47% in aqs and ofs, respectively. However, invasive species introduced from the ornamental fish trade exhibited a mean relative dominance of 10.3% in aqs and 13.5% in ofs. The relative dominance of native species was also significantly higher in ofs (41%) than in aqs (6.5%). The results of this study demonstrated the adverse impacts of aquaculture in regard to the species diversity of fish in localized areas in laguna de bay. The dependency of aquaculture on introduced fish species adversely impacted the natural fish population in the lake. Focusing on the culture of commercially important local species for aquaculture, rather than introduced species, will improve fish production of inland waters without accompanying adverse impacts on biodiversity.","Fish","Species Dispersal","PHL","Asia","2642_Fish","Harmful"

It is critical to monitor and assess the impacts of tourism on ecosystem health. However, there is a general lack of information on biological communities in natural reserves of developing countries and of tools for assessing human impacts. In the present study, we investigated macroinvertebrate assemblages in nine lakes in jiuzhaigou natural reserve of china. Both benthic (20 dips of d-net) and light-trap samples (2 h) were collected at each lake and all benthic specimens and adults of ephemeroptera, plecoptera, and trichoptera (ept) were identified and counted. Water temperature and water quality variables were measured on site or in the lab. Seventy taxa were recorded and dominated by dipterans and caddisflies. Light traps contributed 47% of taxa richness and 66% of ept richness at the lakes. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that water temperature and tourism index were strongly associated with the changes of assemblage composition. Taxa richness and eft richness calculated for the composite samples (benthic+light trap) were well fit with poisson generalized linear model (adjusted r-2 = 0.83 and 0.85, respectively), generally decreasing with increasing elevation, tourism index, and total-n. Tourism index was ranked as the top predictor for ept richness based on multiple model weights, and elevation for taxa richness. In comparison, when based on benthic samples, neither of the metrics could be fitted with the seven environmental variables selected. These findings highlight the benefit of combined use of the sampling methods for lake monitoring and offered an analytical guide to developing biological indicators of lake ecosystem health in protected areas.

The rivers are located in the same ecoregion but have contrasting levels of both hydrological regulations and mitigation measures; the mun river has a hydropower dam with a fish ladder and sluice gates that are opened during the wet season each year, the gam river has several irrigation dams with a fish ladder at each dam site, and the songkhram river has no dams along its river course. A total of 124 freshwater fish species were sampled in these rivers from august 2009 to june 2010. Overall species richness was highest in the songkhram river (112), followed by the mun (97) and gam (54) rivers. Average per site species richness was also significantly different among rivers but not among sampling months. Abundance-biomass comparison plots revealed considerably overlapping distributions of these two metrics from the dry to early rainy seasons in the songkhram river and, to a lesser extent, in the mun river. Fish assemblage data were classified into six clusters with similar community structure. Fish assemblages in the gam river constituted a single cluster, while those in the other two rivers formed multiple clusters depending on the sampling season. The results of the cluster analysis are discussed in relation to the dominance of the three migration guilds (white, black, and grey fishes) of the mekong river fishes. The effectiveness of the mitigation measures was determined to be limited in alleviating adverse impacts of dams in these tributaries of the mekong river.

In this study we aimed to assess the environmental impact of ecotourism on the fish fauna of sucuri river in bonito by integrating ecological, behaviour and physiological criteria and using the fish species crenicichla lepidota and moenkhausia bonita as indicators. Two distinct sites were defined to collect data: (1) affected daily by ecotourism (tourism) and (2) undisturbed (no tourism). The ""stationary point count"" method was performed to assess variations in ecological parameters and ""ad libitum"" and focal animal methods were used to collect behaviour data. The cortisol response of m. Bonita to a stress protocol was measured from holding-water. Results showed a significantly increase in species richness, density and diversity at the tourism site. Nevertheless, behaviour patterns indicated a higher stress at the tourism site for both species as well higher cortisol levels for m. Bonita. In opposition to the ecological measures, the behaviour and physiological ones may be interpreted as an early sign of negative impact caused by ecotourism, prior to changes at community level.","Fish","Tourism","BRA","South America","302_Fish","Harmful"

The capercaillie (tetra urogallus) is an endangered umbrella species of montane forests in central europe. Despite its status, it has largely been overlooked in forest management planning in the carpathian mountains, a biodiversity hotspot within the european union. Previous investigations of timber management effects on capercaillie have shown contradictory results within europe; habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive forest management have been implicated in population declines, while other studies have suggested neutral or positive effects. In romania, recent changes in forest management have shifted from extensive, selective logging to intensive clearcutting; this change provides the opportunity to assess the effects of harvesting on capercaillie numbers across a full range of forest management intensities, thereby addressing discrepancies in the literature. Across the southern and eastern carpathian mountains from 2009-2011, we used spring counts of capercaillie males at leks to evaluate the impact of forest management, other human activities, and habitat at two spatial scales - stand (similar to 2 ha) and landscape (similar to 300 ha). At the landscape level, the proportion of forest clearcuts and intensity of tourism had significant negative effects on the number of capercaillie males in the lek. In contrast, low intensity selective logging had a positive effect at the local stand (lek) level. Large scale (landscape level) forest clear-cutting had a negative effect on the capercaillie population - areas comprised of clearcuts of 30% reduced male lek counts by 76%. The protection of intact mature and old-growth forests, and forest management practices that emulate natural disturbance processes are recommended to support habitat of this critical umbrella species and associated biodiversity.

"311","Human trampling effects on mediterranean coastal dune plants","FARRIS E;PISANU S;CECCHERELLI G;FILIGHEDDU R",2013,"Coastal habitats are particularly vulnerable to recreational impacts because these environments are highly dynamic and continually change in response to biotic and abiotic factors. Sand dune communities are worldwide characterized by high levels of biodiversity, but are often affected by human-induced impacts as those caused by tourist trampling. To understand the effects of human frequentation, trampling, and other human-induced impacts, fencing experiments have been traditionally carried out on coastal dunes. Since in touristic areas dune systems are subjected to different intensities of human frequentations rather than to opening or fencing, in this study we explore the effects of accessibility on vascular plants cover. This study tests the hypothesis that human frequentation on beaches affects spatio-temporal variability of vascular plant abundance on dunes by comparing the plant assemblages of high and low accessible sites in north-east sardinia (italy). Our results show that accessibility plays a crucial role in conditioning the percentage of vegetation cover in mediterranean dunes. In fact, not only we found a perennial vegetation cover that was significantly higher in the sites with low accessibility (and consequently low frequentation), but we also showed that at the sites with high accessibility there were significant differences in vegetation cover between times of sampling (cover was higher before than after summer): on the contrary, differences in perennial vegetation cover among times were not significant at the low frequentation sites. After summer, the difference among low and high frequentation sites in species composition and cover was >90%. Multivariate analysis identified those species that play a pivotal role in differentiating the low and the high frequentation sites. Among them, crucianella maritima and sporobolus virginicus can be considered as differential species. Overall, our data show vegetation and plant species responses to human-induced impacts, and are therefore important to support conservation actions in mediterranean coastal areas interested by mass tourism.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Tourism","ITA","Europe","311_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Harmful"

However, few studies have investigated the effect of regular trampling on these fragile ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different conservation strategies (open access, partial protection, and total long-term closure) on intertidal reef tops in porto de galinhas and tamandar,, pernambuco state, brazil. Analysis of the macrobenthic community was performed with photo transects and image analysis (cpce). Twenty-seven transects were surveyed from january to august 2012, in intensively impacted (i) open-access sites, in partially protected (p) sites with occasional, illegal trampling, and in a permanently closed (c) site. In i sites, total live cover was half the cover found in adjacent p sites. The area of bare rock averaged 53.6 and 25.0 % in i and p sites, respectively. In the c site, the area of bare rock was only 19.8 %. In i and p sites, macroalgae (palisada perforata) were dominating, while in the c site, the zoanthid zoanthus sociatus was most abundant. Shell-bearing vermetids (petaloconchus varians) and bivalves (isognomon bicolor) were more abundant at the c site, being possible bioindicators for areas with zero or little trampling. Twelve years of total closure produced near-pristine communities in the c site, dominated by zoanthids and fragile mollusks. This study showed that trampling has severe and long-lasting consequences for the structure of these ecosystems.","Invertebrates","Tourism","BRA","South America","3112_Invertebrates","Harmful"

The status of freshwater biota in the vicinity of existing dams could be valuable to predict the effects of such developments, but detailed ecological monitoring before and after dam construction is frequently lacking. 2.In the absence of these data, we used a space-for-time replacement to compare a key component of the aquatic biota at upstream and downstream sites, with the latter more closely resembling river channel conditions prior to the dam. We assessed the fish assemblages upstream and downstream of the coaracy nunes dam in amapa, brazil, the first ecological study at this site since this dam was constructed 42years earlier. We used gillnets during eight bimonthly field campaigns, covering both wet and dry seasons, and sampled the ichthyofauna (1819 individuals, 81 species) at four sites: downstream channel, reservoir, upstream lake and upstream channel. 3.We found clear negative impacts on the abundance, biomass, species richness, alpha diversity and species dominance upstream of the dam. The physical subdivision of the river channel and the upstream channel conversion from lentic to lotic habitats were strongly associated with differences in the composition and structure of fish communities. Notable changes include an increased contribution of small-bodied fish in the reservoir and an absence of long-distance migrants upstream of the dam. 4.Downstream channel habitats, in particular, retained their fish diversity with high conservation value typical of eastern amazonia, yet these areas now face the threat of new hydropower development farther downstream. The long-term impacts on aquatic biodiversity highlighted in this study are especially relevant in the face of burgeoning new hydroelectricity development plans for rivers across lowland amazonia.","Fish","Energy Transfer","BRA","South America","3122_Fish","Changed"

We analysed the ecological constraints and the conservation status of the eastern population of helianthemum caput-felis boiss. (Cistaceae), located in sardinia. The distribution of h. Caput-felis was verified via field surveys; ecological data, morphological and reproductive traits, were recorded in 40 permanent plots randomly established; the human trampling effects on plant density, plant size and plant performance were analysed. Plant density was higher in bedrock and lowland areas, in garrigue and maquis habitats; however, the differences among plants growing in different ecological conditions were not statistically significant; only human trampling intensity significantly affected plant density and lowest values were observed in areas with intense trampling pressure. All ecological variables analysed had a statistically significant effect on plant size and on the number of fruits per plant. In particular, larger plants were found in areas with the following ecological features: presence of structured soil, on the slopes, in the maquis habitat, and in areas with intensive human trampling. Conversely, plants displayed a higher fruits output per plant in deep and structured soil, in lowland areas, and in the garrigue and maquis habitats; the mean fruits output per plant increased as human trampling intensified. Human-induced threats are the main hazards threatening the remaining sardinian population. In particular, the major threats are linked to tourism and other outdoor activities (i.e. Human trampling), followed by the expansion of agricultural activities; all of these threats result in the disappearance of small localities and in reduced population size due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Our study indicates that h. Caput-felis should be considered as critically endangered (cr) at the regional level. Urgent measures should be undertaken to protect the remaining h. Caput-felis population in sardinia and a possible integrated strategy for the conservation and management consists of a combination of in situ and ex situ measures. In particular, greater emphasis should be given to minimizing the negative impacts of unsustainable tourism and recreation use, in order to exclude human trampling and to facilitate the plant recruitment process and population renewal. In addition, an ex situ conservation strategy must be implemented and the seeds collected could be used for future translocations in suitable areas. Moreover, considering the threats observed, a long-term monitoring programme must be developed to reveal changes in the species conservation status.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Tourism","ITA","Europe","3165_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Mixed"

Therefore, how communities generate knowledge and apply it to resource management practices influence the potential for biodiversity conservation of agroforestry systems. In this study, we investigated the use of knowledge by farmers to manage coffee (coffea arabica) agroforests and the consequences for the conservation of tree biodiversity and composition of surrounding forests. We interviewed 50 coffee farmers to investigate their shade tree preferences and sources of knowledge of the properties of shade trees and coffee management practices; we also conducted tree inventories in 31 coffee farms and 10 forest sites in la sepultura biosphere reserve in chiapas, mexico. Our results showed that farmers are modifying agroforests according to their knowledge and tree preferences, and that the resulting agroforest is lower in tree diversity and dominated by pioneer and farmers' preferred tree species as compared to forests. The principal sources of knowledge of management practices are external sources, such as governmental and non-governmental organizations, whereas the primary source of tree specific knowledge is empirical knowledge. We found that the higher proportion of pioneer trees relative to forest is mostly explained by farmers' tree selection decisions (63%) rather than as a byproduct of management practices (37%) that disturb the soil and open the canopy, altering light penetration and microclimate conditions. Based on interviews and tree inventories, we found that farmers gradually replace canopy trees of neutral and disliked species by preferred species, in particular inga spp. We found that external sources continue to promote the idea that inga spp. Trees bring significant benefits to coffee production in spite of a lack of scientific evidence to support this claim. This indicates that farmers are receptive to incorporate outside knowledge into their knowledge systems and adapt their resource management practices accordingly. Our findings highlight the importance of disseminating sound and clear scientific information to practitioners who work directly with farming communities to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information is being contributed to local knowledge systems.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Knowledge Transfer","MEX","North America","3247_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Harmful"

Neither the number of observed specimens nor the species richness decreased in the control spots. The huge size of the chamber is assumed to prevent significant microclimatic changes and the presence of very large boulders and cracks is assumed to offer plenty of suitable spaces, which allow invertebrates to escape local disturbance and illumination. In spite of the high vulnerability of cave organisms, disturbance of cave habitats does not necessarily result in biodiversity decrease, if the cave disturbance is limited in duration, intensity, and spatial coverage with respect to the cave size.","Invertebrates","Tourism","FRA","Europe","3361_Invertebrates","Not significant or unclear"

These ecosystems are also a magnet for tourists, who prefer these locations as leisure and holiday destinations, and such activity further increases the factors that have an adverse effect on beaches. In the study reported here the effect of human trampling on macrofauna assemblages that inhabit intertidal areas of sandy beaches was assessed using a baci design. For this purpose, three contrasting sectors of the same beach were investigated: an urban area with a high level of visitors, a protected sector with a low density of users, and a transitional area with a high level of human occupancy. The physical variables were constant over time in each sector, whereas differences were found in the intensity of human use between sectors. Density variations and changes in the taxonomic structure of the macrofauna with time were shown by permanova analysis in the urban and transitional locations whereas the protected sector remained constant throughout the study period. The amphipod bathyporeia pelagica appears sensitive to human trampling pressure and the use of this species as a bioindicator for these types of impact is recommended. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

Interactions between invasive and indigenous taxa across trophic levels often tend to propagate throughout the ecosystem, but also those at the same trophic level may affect biodiversity. Here, we examine faunal interactions between an invasive asian morph of the cerithioidean gastropod melanoides tuberculata and indigenous gastropods in long-lived lake malawi. Studying quantitative samples, we document a negative spatial correlation between the established invader and endemic melanoides species, and positive ones between invasive and native m. Tuberculata, and between native melanoides and schistosome-transmitting bulinus. Comparison of modern and fossil samples indicates that melanoides communities have changed since the middle holocene from consisting predominantly of endemic taxa (95%) toward a dominance by non-endemics (80%). External evidence suggests that ecosystem change, such as increased sedimentation and eutrophication, and interactions between the invasive and endemic melanoides species are the most likely causes for these changes. More in-depth study of the benthic ecosystem is required to document interaction mechanisms better, but the invasive taxon is playing an important role in reshaping communities and diversity in lake malawi.","Invertebrates","Species Dispersal","MWI","Africa","3511_Invertebrates","Changed"

Oreganus) in response to disturbance","LOMAS EMILY;MAIDA JARED R;BISHOP CHRISTINE A;LARSEN KARL W",2019,"Anthropogenic disturbances often present novel habitat features to which the members of an existing population must adapt. We examined the effects of disturbance and habitat fragmentation on the movements of northern pacific rattlesnakes (crotalus o. Oreganus) from 2006 through 2012 in southern british columbia, canada. We radio-tracked 44 adult male rattlesnakes through shrub-steppe, grassland, and dry forest habitats that varied from highly disturbed and fragmented to near pristine with little human interaction. Sources of disturbance were primarily associated with tourism (gol course, campground, hiking trails, roads, parking lots, vineyards, condominium complex). After accounting for interyear variation and daily temperature, rattlesnakes in undisturbed areas had larger home ranges (100% minimal convex polygon) an longer home-range lengths compared to individuals frequenting minimally to highly disturbed areas. Contrary to our predictions, snakes in highly disturbed sites did not move greater total distances, display elevated movement frequencies, higher movement rates, and/or more convoluted movement patterns.","Reptiles","Tourism","CAN","North America","357_Reptiles","Not significant or unclear"

The present study investigated the distribution patterns of aquatic insect populations in the sentinela stream in biribiri state park, diamantina, minas gerais, brazil, and we correlated the patterns to possible impacts caused by tourists. We sampled the aquatic insect population few days before and few days after the holidays and monthly during the year. Fifteen groups of samples were taken from january through december 2011 at four different sites. For each site, three sub-samples were taken by drifting the entomological net and disturbing the substrate using the kick method. 3601 individuals were collected, and 8 orders and 41 families were identified. Environmental indices showed excellent water quality for sites 1 and 2, which are minimally affected by tourism and average water quality for sites 3 and 4, which are highly impacted by tourism. Three of the four holiday periods analyzed showed a significant decrease in insect abundance after the holiday. The richness and diversity of the aquatic insect fauna did not show seasonal fluctuations, despite differences in stream flow velocity during the dry and rainy periods. Our results indicated that the disturbances caused by tourism affect directly the diversity and abundance of aquatic insects in the sentinela stream. In addition, these insects were suitable for the evaluation of human impacts caused by tourism in the conservation of freshwater ecosystem.","Invertebrates","Tourism","BRA","South America","3583_Invertebrates","Harmful"

Once introduced into its new environment, feral populations may arise and pose threats to local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In france, it is in fact considered as a risk for the mediterranean pond turtle, mauremys leprosa, and the european pond turtle, emys orbicularis, as they may compete for resources and habitat. Freshwater turtles are also host to a variety of parasites including protozoans and helminths. When introduced turtles escape, parasites may spread to native species. The objective of this study was to document the extent of platyhelminth invasions from t. S. Elegans to natural m. Leprosa populations in northern spain and southern france and to evaluate the risks that parasite host-switching may pose on indigenous freshwater turtle species. From dna barcoding analysis based on the sequencing of the cytochrome c oxidase i gene, the bayesian tree and p-distance comparisons of closely related haplotypes revealed a greater polystome richness within m. Leprosa than expected, suggesting that host switching may take place in natural environments. Because these parasites most typically infest american turtles like chrysemys picta marginata and graptemys pseudogeographica in their natural home range and because parasites were also found within t. S. Elegans feral populations, it is suggested that the red-eared slider would serve as a carrier for a variety of not strictly host-specific polystomes that are transmitted to m. Leprosa throughout the south of france. The global trade in freshwater turtles thus provides opportunity for parasites to be transported to new destinations which could impact the physiology, behavior and survival of native turtle species.","Reptiles","Species Dispersal","FRA;ESP;DZA","Europe;Africa","3668_Reptiles","Harmful"

After a population collapse that reached its nadir in the 1970s, the guanaco lama guanicoe population in tierra del fuego, chile, recovered and is now in conflict with sheep ranching and commercial logging. We studied the effects of livestock density and environmental factors on guanaco abundance and spatial ecology, using seasonal counts and radio-telemetry in a private protected area (karukinka) and neighbouring ranches in a forest-grassland mosaic in tierra del fuego. Guanaco density was highest in low-elevation areas with more grassland cover and little snow accumulation in winter. In low-elevation areas, guanaco density decreased with increasing livestock density. Radio-tracked guanacos exhibited a partial migration pattern: two individuals migrated seasonally, selecting grasslands and avoiding forests mainly in summer, whereas six sedentary individuals used habitats according to their availability. Migratory guanacos spent the summer in karukinka and winter on nearby ranches. High sheep densities and poor range condition on the ranches reduce key forage resources available to guanacos and may promote use of forests by guanacos, affecting forest regeneration and increasing conflict with logging. Current guanaco harvest by loggers may fail to reduce the impact of guanacos on logged-forest regeneration if guanaco spatial ecology and sheep management are not considered. Our results provide insight into the interactions among guanacos, forests and livestock ranching, and may be used to reduce conflicts and guide conservation in the fuegian ecosystem.","Mammals","Trade","CHL","South America","3697_Mammals","Harmful"

This study examined the temporal genetic consequences of historical river fragmentation by hydroelectric dams on lake sturgeon (acipenser fulvescens rafinesque, 1817), using temporal samples from two ontario river systems. Temporal genetic analyses of samples from the ottawa (dammed) and kenogami (unregulated) river systems were used to (1) compare changes in genetic structure and diversity within and between free-flowing and regulated systems; (2) assess how impoundments have influenced the spatial and temporal genetic structure and diversity within these contrasting systems; and (3) estimate effective population sizes (n-e) in both rivers using temporal genetic estimators. Levels of genetic diversity did not differ between impounded and free-flowing rivers, nor did genetic diversity differ through time within a river system. Levels of genetic divergence over time were similarly minimal. We did, however, detect a 65% decline in effective population size in the impounded ottawa river over two generations. Moreover, over the same time period the ottawa river had substantially lower n-e estimates for lake sturgeon than the free-flowing kenogami river system. This study represents one of the first to observe genetic consequences of fragmentation on lake sturgeon. As such, this work reinforces the importance of maintaining or restoring habitat connectivity and availability for this migratory species, and mitigating other demographic threats that could compound, or be compounded by the effect of reduced genetic variation.","Fish","Energy Transfer","CAN","North America","3772_Fish","Not significant or unclear"

Some species are tolerant or even benefit from environmental conditions such as ocean warming, acidification, and eutrophication. In consequence, increases in sponge bioerosion have been observed on some coral reefs over the last decades. The abrolhos bank is the largest coral reef system in the south atlantic. It has been affected by sedimentation, eutrophication, overfishing, and climate change, mainly affecting coastal reefs, and at lesser intensity outer ones as well. This study aimed to describe spatial and temporal patterns in bioeroding sponge distribution in carbonate substrates in the abrolhos bank. Photo-quadrats were used to compare bioeroding sponge abundance between two shallow reefs: a coastal, pedra de leste (pl), and an outer reef, parcel dos abrolhos (pab). Each individual was delimitated over the substrate by determining the sponge surface through a line connecting the outermost papillae. The study was conducted over 6 years in 2008-2009 and 2013-2016. Four species of bioeroding sponges were identified: cliona carteri ridley, 1881, c. Delitrix pang, 1973, c. Cf. Schmidtii ridley, 1881, and siphonodictyon coralliphagum rutzler, 1971. The distribution and abundance of species varied between the inner and outer reefs and across the years, and displayed certain selectivity for the calcareous substrates recorded. Crustose coralline algae (cca) were the main substrate excavated by the most abundant bioeroding species, c. Carteri, and represented 70% of the substrate types occupied by this sponge (cca, coral overgrown by cca and plain coral). The highest abundance of bioeroding sponges observed in photo-quadrats was 21.3 individuals/m(2) at the outer reefs (pab) in 2014. The abundances or areal extents of bioeroding sponges were up to 10 times greater on the outer reefs than on the coastal ones, where sedimentation is higher and more strongly influenced by siliciclastic material. Moreover, a higher herbivorous fish biomass has been reported on outer reefs which could also influence the higher abundance of bioeroding sponges in outer reefs. During the study period of 6 years, an increase in bioeroding sponge abundance was observed at the outer reefs (pab), with the sea surface temperature increase. As cca have an important role in reefal cementation and carbonate production in the abrolhos reefs, a bioerosion impact might be expected, in particular, on the outer reefs.","Invertebrates","Species Dispersal","BRA","South America","379_Invertebrates","Harmful"

In this study, bryophyte diversity affected by different levels of human disturbance in five karst sinkholes was compared. A total of 132 species of bryophytes (17 liverworts and 115 mosses) that belong to 64 genera and 30 families were recorded. The richness of the bryophytes in the natural sinkholes was significantly higher than that of the bryophytes in the sinkholes affected by tourism and used as farmland. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that soil moisture is one of the most important factors that affect the abundance of bryophyte distribution in the five sinkholes. Human activities, including agriculture, animal husbandry, and tourism development, reduce the bryophyte coverage of sinkholes and lead to soil moisture loss. Therefore, effective protection of karst sinkholes is required to maintain their original value for biodiversity conservation.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Tourism","CHN","Asia","3790002_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Harmful"

Management agencies then face the difficult task of providing recreation and tourism opportunities without compromising environmental values. This study assessed the success of efforts aimed at conserving alpine vegetation along the mt bogong massif in victoria, australia, through controlling the use of horses. Vegetation condition was assessed in 2001 to coinciding with restrictions on the use of horse riding on trails and then resurveyed 10years later. Sampling was undertaken in track plots that included the trail and surrounding vegetation, and control plots located away from the trail. There were significant differences in the amount of bare ground, the height of shrubs and ground layer vegetation, and shrub cover between track and control plots in 2001. Ten years later, track plots were recovering with reductions in bare ground and changes in vegetation, with improved ground layer vegetation height. Results show that vegetation condition has improved with restrictions of horse numbers. The indicators selected were sensitive to changes in vegetation condition and hence should be used for ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of this and similar management interventions.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Tourism","AUS","Oceania","3868_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Changed"

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics.","Mammals","Trade","CRI","North America","3924_Mammals","Not significant or unclear"
"396","A continental scale analysis of threats to orchids","WRAITH JENNA;PICKERING CATHERINE",2019,"Thousands of plants are at risk of extinction globally due to human activities, including many species of orchids. In australia alone there are 184 orchids identified as threatened by the australian government, but what threatens them and where are they threatened? Using data derived from listing documents for these orchids, threats were allocated to 28 categories. Then, the distributions of the orchids and hence likely geographic patterns of threats were mapped using 14,651 location records from the atlas of living australia. The most common threats were changes in fire regimes (74% of threatened australian orchids), invasive species (65%), habitat modification (64%), grazing (63%), tourism and recreation (47%) and illegal collection (46%), which often co-occurred as threat syndromes. Most threatened orchids are terrestrial (165 species), and many occur in temperate forests (96) and temperate shrubland (36). When generalised linear models were used to assess geographic patterns in threats, bioregions with less cover of native vegetation were more likely to have orchids threatened by habitat modification, grazing or weeds (p < 0.05). Bioregions with higher protected area coverage were more likely to contain orchids threatened by tourism and recreation, but less likely to have orchids threatened by habitat modification (p < 0.05). Understanding drivers of threats and their distribution is crucial for successful management as they highlight key areas for conservation. The results also highlight the need for updating orchid listings nationally and internationally to better reflect the diversity of orchids threatened and threats to them, including the increasing impact of climate change.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Tourism","AUS","Oceania","396_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Harmful"

In this study, we have examined whether ten years of potential increased human pressures have resulted in significant changes in the macrofaunal assemblages' structure and composition of two mesotidal sandy beaches (cabedelo - urban beach, and quiaios - rural beach) on the european atlantic coast (portugal). Seasonal macrofauna collections were performed at both beaches in two different periods, one in 1999-2000 and another in 2010-2011. The physical variables did not change significantly in both beaches throughout the studied periods, however, the urban beach was subject to an increase of human pressures (tourism and shoreline modifications) over the 10-years interval considered when compared with the rural beach. The univariate community descriptors (total density, species richness and diversity) did not differ significantly among periods for the rural beach. In contrast, temporal differences were found at the most urbanised beach, principally regarding the abundances of the amphipod talitrus saltator and the isopod tylos europaeus, two of the most abundant species at both beaches. Permanova tests enhanced these temporal variations and the simper analysis attributed to these species the main differences found between periods in this beach. Since the physical environment was similar in both periods, the ecological changes were most likely attributed to the increased human pressures observed at the urban beach. Nevertheless, this study highlights the need of further robust and effective impact assessments and long-term studies to better discern between natural and human induced changes on sandy beaches.

Satellite images and aerial photography were used to characterize coastal types (e.g. Substrate, geomorphology and wave energy to describe beaches, mangroves, or rocky shores), and then field assessments ranked four types of anthropogenic impacts that influence ecosystem function and coastal system services. The ranking of coastal health was based on physical alterations, destructive use of the coastal zone, coastal development and occurrence of invasive alien species (ias). The characterization and assessment methods were developed to serve as a rapid survey of coastal stability, biological diversity and quality of wildlife habitats. A system of coastal ranking is presented using numerical scores for four impact criteria along with terrestrial plant surveys to examine the intactness of the coastal environment. Some locations (exuma and great guana cay) were repeatedly monitored over time. Scores ranged from ""0"" for no human impacts or invasive coastal plants to ""20"" for highly altered with dredging, coastal development and loss of native vegetation. The mean impact rank for all sites across all islands was 5.7 +/- 4.3, which indicates ""medium"" ranks for at least two of the four human impact criteria. Only one uninhabited island (cay sal) had all coastal impacts scores of ""none"". Over 77% of all the sites surveyed had abundant occurrences of invasive alien species (ias) coastal plants. The australian pine (casuarina equisetifolia) was the more pervasive and the most widespread ias in the coastal environment, and its abundance increased in all sites that were re-surveyed over time. Degradation of coastal function can signal greater risks to coastal property, flooding events or loss of wildlife populations. The coastal impact ranking protocol presented here helps identify target areas for conservation as well as identify areas with the greatest feasibility for coastal restoration. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

We used weather-surveillance radar to conduct broad regional assessments of bird response to mbhi activities within the mississippi alluvial valley and the west gulf coastal plain. Across both regions, birds responded positively to mbhi management by exhibiting greater relative bird densities within sites relative to pre-management conditions in prior years and relative to surrounding non-flooded agricultural lands. Bird density at mbhi sites was generally greatest during winter for both regions. Unusually high flooding in the years prior to implementation of the mbhi confounded detection of overall changes in remotely sensed soil wetness across sites. The magnitude of bird response at mbhi sites compared to prior years and to non-flooded agricultural lands was generally related to the surrounding landscape context: proximity to areas of high bird density, amount of forested wetlands, emergent marsh, non-flooded agriculture, or permanent open water. However, these relationships varied in strength and direction between regions and seasons, a finding which we attribute to differences in seasonal bird composition and broad regional differences in landscape configuration and composition. We detected greater increases in relative bird use at sites in closer proximity to areas of high bird density during winter in both regions. Additionally, bird density was greater during winter at sites with more emergent marsh in the surrounding landscape. Thus, bird use of managed wetlands could be maximized by enrolling lands located near areas of known bird concentration and within a mosaic of existing wetlands. Weather-radar observations provide strong evidence that mbhi sites located inland from coastal wetlands impacted by the oil spill provided wetland habitat used by a variety of birds.","Birds","Knowledge Transfer","USA","North America","4087_Birds","Not significant or unclear"

We examined the effects of conventional oil and gas development on forest habitat including amounts of core and edge forest, the abundance of songbird species and guilds, species diversity, and community similarity within and between mixed hardwood and oak forest types at both individual wells (local scale) and at the 25-ha scale at differing levels of well density: reference (0wells/site, 0wells/km(2)), low (1-5wells/site, 4-20 wells/km(2)), and high (10-15wells/site, 40-60wells/km(2)). Amount of cleared area, length of roads, and amount of edge increased with increasing well density, whereas amount of core forest declined. At high well densities, 85% of the study site remained forested, but the mean amount of core forest declined from 68% to 2%. Specific changes to forest structure associated with oil and gas development included decreases in basal area and canopy cover within 20m of individual wells and with increasing well density. Of 19 species analyzed, 5 species, including ovenbird (seiurus aurocapilla), blackburnian warbler (setophaga fusca), and black-throated green warbler (setophaga virens), had lower abundance at well sites than reference sites at either the local or 25-ha scale. Six species including american robin (turdus migratorius), chestnut-sided warbler (setophaga pensylvanica), and brown-headed cowbird (molothrus ater) were more abundant at well than reference sites. Eight species did not differ in abundance between well and reference sites. All 3 songbird guilds showed distinct patterns of abundance in relation to habitat differences resulting from oil and gas development that were consistent with known fragmentation effects. Forest interior species were less abundant at well sites than reference sites and showed a declining trend with increasing well density. In contrast, the guilds of early successional species and synanthropic species were more abundant at well sites than reference sites as was species richness (alpha diversity). Avian communities differed between northern hardwood and oak forest types at reference sites but became more similar when wells were present at both scales, suggesting biotic homogenization or a loss of beta diversity occurred as similar species were attracted to well sites in both forest types. The bird communities associated with northern hardwoods and oaks still retained their unique characteristics at low well densities but became similar at high well densities suggesting a threshold somewhere between the low and high well density sites.

However, an increasing number of reports have shown the presence and spread of non-native plants in antarctica; it is therefore important to study which factors control the invasion process in this ecosystem. Here, we assessed the role of different human activities on the presence and abundance of the invasive poa annua. In addition, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment in the field, and a manipulative experiment of germination with p. Annua and the natives colobanthus quitensis and deschampsia antarctica, in order to unravel the effects of physical soil disturbance on the establishment and survival of p. Annua. We found a positive correlation between abundance of p. Annua and level of soil disturbance, and that survival of p. Annua was 33% higher in sites with disturbed soil than non-disturbed. Finally, we found that disturbance conditions increased germination for p. Annua, whereas for native species germination in experimentally disturbed soil was either unchanged or reduced compared to undisturbed soil. Our results indicate that human activities that modify abiotic soil characteristics could play an important role in the abundance of this invasive species. If the current patterns of human activities are maintained in antarctica, the establishment success and spread of p. Annua could increase, negatively affecting native flora.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Migration (human)","ATA","Antarctica","4209_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Not significant or unclear"

"4257","Effects of an alien invasive gastropod on native benthic assemblages in coastal lakes of the isimangaliso wetland park, south africa","MIRANDA N A F;PERISSINOTTO R",2014,"Tarebia granifera (lamarck, 1822) is one of the most widespread alien invasive molluscs around the world and was accidentally introduced into south africa via the aquarium trade during the 1990s. It has invaded and spread in the estuaries and lakes of the isimangaliso wetland park, where it is often present in extremely high densities. There are no studies directly addressing the impact of t. Granifera on benthic fauna of invaded habitats in south africa. This study aimed to compile useful historic and current benthic community and environmental data for a comparison between pre- and post-invasion scenarios involving t. Granifera in the shallow water habitats (depth < 2.6 metres) of different lakes in the isimangaliso wetland park. Results provide evidence that t. Granifera can dominate and thus significantly affect native invertebrate assemblage composition. Under certain environmental conditions, some native gastropod species can be displaced by t. Granifera. However, t. Granifera does not appear to markedly affect the biodiversity of aquatic coastal ecosystems. This study serves as a baseline for future research.

Toassess how continued use of a hiking trail coupled with changes in local climate affect a rare australian alpine plant community, we compared plant composition at different distances from a trail in 2013 during wetter conditions with that 10 years prior during a drought in 2003. In both years, only a few trampling-tolerant graminoids and cushion plants were found on the trail surface, which runs along the ridgeline. Species richness and cover in both surveys generally increased with distance from the trail, but there were differences between the windward and leeward sides of the trail. This included increased abundance of some species but continued disruption of shrub succession on the leeward side of the trail. There was an overall increase in species richness between the two surveys, and changes in the abundance of many species independent of trampling effects, possibly reflecting the more favourable/wetter conditions for plant growth in 2013. These results suggest that changes in climatic conditions can affect community composition, but that this has not negated the impact of the hiking trail on this rare community. With average temperatures increasing, and snow cover declining in the australian alps, it is likely that there will be even more changes in the windswept feldmark, including the potential colonisation of these ridges by more competitive species, such as graminoids, at the expense of the dominant shrub and some herbs that are already adversely affected by trampling. Longer term monitoring of this rare community is imperative to better understand community processes in relation to the impacts of trail use and climate change. Management options to reduce these impacts are discussed.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Tourism","AUS","Oceania","4293_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Not significant or unclear"

These characterization factors are expressed as the potentially disappeared fraction (pdf) of native freshwater fish species in the rivers rhine and danube integrated over space and time per amount of goods transported (pdf.m(3).Yr.kg(-1)). Furthermore, we quantified the relative importance of exotic fish species introduction compared to other anthropogenic stressors in the freshwater environment (i.e., eutrophication, ecotoxicity, greenhouse gases, and water consumption) for transport of goods through the rhine-main-danube waterway. We found that the introduction of exotic fish species contributed to 70-85% of the total freshwater ecosystem impact, depending on the distance that goods were transported. Our analysis showed that it is relevant and feasible to include the introduction of exotic species in an lca framework. The proposed framework can be further extended by including the impacts of other exotic species groups, types of water bodies and pathways for introduction.","Fish","Trade;Species Dispersal","DEU;NLD;BEL;HUN;AUT;SVK;LUX;FRA","Europe","4393_Fish","Harmful"

This study investigated the effects of tourist usage of roads vs. Hiking trails on bird communities in gorges of the flinders ranges, a popular south australian tourist destination in the arid-lands. High tourist usage along roads decreased the individual abundance and species richness of birds relative to low usage trails. The decrease in species richness, though less pronounced, also occurred at high-usage sites along trails. Changes in the species response to recreational disturbance/impacts varied depending on the ecology of the species. Bigger, more competitive birds with a generalist diet were overrepresented at high-usage sites along roads and trails. Species using microhabitats in lower vegetation layers were more sensitive. However, structural and floristic complexity of vegetation was a more important factor influencing bird abundance than tourist usage. Sites with a better developed shrub and tree layer sustained higher species abundance and richer communities. Importantly, vegetation qualities moderated the negative effect of high usage on the individual abundance of birds along roads, to the extent that such an effect was absent at sites with the best developed shrub and tree layer. To protect avifauna along recreational tracks in arid-lands gorges, we recommend the closure of some gorges or sections for vehicle or any access. Further, open space particularly for camping needs to be minimized as it creates areas of high tourist usage with modified habitat that provides birds with little buffer from disturbance.

Higher trail use along more major trail types were associated with significantly fewer fieldsigns along transects close to trails, compared with more distant transects. Fieldsign scores along transects adjacent to less used, unpaved trails were far less affected. In multiple-regression models, species and guilds exhibited different fieldsign score responses to trail type and use.

We suggest that the multibillion dollar cashmere industry creates economic motivations that link western fashion preferences for cashmere to land use in central asia. This penchant for stylish clothing, in turn, encourages herders to increase livestock production which affects persistence of over 6 endangered large mammals in these remote, arid ecosystems. We hypothesized that global trade in cashmere has strong negative effects on native large mammals of deserts and grassland where cashmere-producing goats are raised. We used time series data, ecological snapshots of the biomass of native and domestic ungulates, and ecologically and behaviorally based fieldwork to test our hypothesis. In mongolia increases in domestic goat production were associated with a 3-fold increase in local profits for herders coexisting with endangered saiga(saiga tatarica).That increasing domestic grazing pressure carries fitness consequences was inferred on the basis of an approximately 4-fold difference in juvenile recruitment among blue sheep(pseudois nayaur)in trans-himalayan india. Across 7 study areas in mongolia, india, and china's tibetan plateau, native ungulate biomass is now<5% that of domestic species. Such trends suggest ecosystem degradation and decreased capacity for the persistence of native species, including at least 8 asian endemic species: saiga, chiru(pantholops hodgsoni), bactrian camel(camelus bactrianus), snow leopard(panthera uncia), khulan(equus hemionus), kiang(e.

Flow dynamics is a major determinant of riparian plant communities. Therefore, flow regulation may heavily affect riparian ecosystems. Despite the large number of dams worldwide, little specific information is available on the longitudinal impacts of dams on vegetation, for example how far downstream and at what degree of regulation a dam on a river can influence riparian woodlands. 2. We quantified the long-term responses of riparian trees and shrubs to flow regulation by identifying their lateral distribution and habitat conditions along a boreal river in northern sweden that has been regulated by a single dam since 1948. The regulation has reduced annual flow fluctuations, this effect being largest at the dam, downstream from which it progressively decreases following the entrance of free-flowing tributaries. 3. We related changes in the distribution patterns, composition, abundance and richness of tree and shrub species to the degree of regulation along the river downstream from the dam. Regulation has triggered establishment of trees and shrubs closer to the channel, making it possible to measure ecological impacts of flow regulation as differences in vegetation attributes relative to the positions of tree and shrub communities established before and after regulation. 4. Trees and shrubs had migrated towards the mid-channel along the entire study reach, but the changes were largest immediately downstream of the dam. Shrubs were most impacted by flow regulation in terms of lateral movement, but the effect on trees extended furthest downstream. 5. The species composition of trees progressively returned to its pre-regulation state with distance downstream, but entrance of free-flowing tributaries and variation in channel morphology and substratum caused local deviations. Species richness after regulation increased for trees but decreased for shrubs. The changes in species composition and richness of trees and shrubs showed no clear downstream patterns, suggesting that other factors than the degree of regulation were more important in governing life form.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Water Transfer","SWE","Europe","466_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Mixed"

We sampled at sites adjacent to coastal resorts, and at a distance of up to 5.7 km from resorts, in three habitat types (mixed mangrove, semi-deciduous, and coastal scrub forests). We tested for differences in abundance and richness at sites near and far from resorts and among the three habitat types. We also assessed whether bird distribution was associated with fruit abundance and/or vegetation characteristics. Across seasons, migrants were consistently more abundant at sites near resorts than at sites more distant, whereas richness of cuban residents was consistently higher at sites near resorts than at those farther away. Neither abundance nor richness of the resident guild varied significantly by habitat. The distributions of neither migrants nor residents were correlated with fruit abundance. High foliage density associated with greater edge habitat provided the strongest explanation for high estimates of abundance and richness of migrants and residents near resorts. Our results suggest that moderately disturbed forests near resorts can support abundant and rich communities of both migrants and residents.","Birds","Tourism","CUB","North America","471_Birds","Mixed"

Such changes in aboveground vegetation might have stronger impacts on belowground biodiversity. We studied tropical rainforest fragments and derived rubber plantations at a network of sites in xishuangbanna, china, hypothesizing a major decrease in diversity with conversion to plantations. We used metabarcoding of the 18s rrna gene and recovered 2313 otus, with a total of 449 otus shared between the two land-use types. The most abundant phyla detected were annelida (66.4% reads) followed by arthropods (15.5% reads) and nematodes (8.9% reads). Of these, only annelids were significantly more abundant in rubber plantation. Taken together, alpha- and beta-diversity were significantly higher in forest than rubber plantation. Soil ph and spatial distance explained a significant portion of the variability in phylogenetic community structure for both land-use types. Community assembly was primarily influenced by stochastic processes. Overall it appears that forest replacement by rubber plantation results in an overall loss and extensive replacement of soil micro- and mesofaunal biodiversity, which should be regarded as an additional aspect of the impact of forest conversion.","Invertebrates","Trade","CHN","Asia","479_Invertebrates","Harmful"
"483","The elephant in the ""room': determinants of songbird assemblages in the thicket biome, south africa","PARKER D M",2019,"When vegetation structure is altered, songbird communities may be affected. Despite speculation that african elephant (loxodonta africana) browsing impacts bird communities, existing data are limited. I sampled the bird communities of the albany thicket biome at 10 sites in the eastern cape, south africa, half with elephants and half without. Songbird community parameters were best predicted by how long elephants had been present, elephant density and the percentage cover of thicket vegetation. The sites where elephants had been present for longer had more bird species and increased songbird density and diversity. However, bird density also increased with increasing thicket vegetation cover and this is a phenomenon unlikely to be compatible with long-term elephant presence. There was an almost equal split between the number of bird species that appeared to be negatively affected by changes in habitat structure (47%) and those which benefited (53%). Smaller birds were generally more abundant as vegetation structural integrity increased and larger birds were more abundant when vegetation structural integrity declined. The browsing of elephants could be viewed as facilitative for songbirds in the short term. However, this effect may not persist in the long term because all elephant populations (notorious tree-fellers) in the eastern cape are found in fenced areas where natural migration is not possible. More broadly, my data provide important insight into how avian communities respond to habitat transformation at the local and regional scales.","Birds","Tourism","ZAF","Africa","483_Birds","Not significant or unclear"

Qeshm island located at the strait of hormuz, with an area of 1,491 km(2), is the largest island in the region. This island consists of a number of important natural habitat types including creeks, mangroves, corals, and sandy, muddy, and rocky shores that accommodate diverse marine flora and fauna communities. Two rocky shores were selected at the touristic beaches being visited regularly, and further two control locations selected at pristine shores. Intertidal macroinvertebrates were collected from six microhabitats including rock platforms, cobbles, boulders, crevices, sea walls, and rock pools during two different periods representing high and low tourist seasons. Species richness, density, and assemblage structure in heavily visited shores were compared with that of control locations. Striped barnacles (balanus amphitrite) were present on platforms of all locations, thus the changes in their size were used as the obvious contrast associated with visitor's impact. A total of 70 macroinvertebrate species from 11 phyla were recorded. Significant differences were detected in taxonomic richness, density, and assemblage structure of macroinvertebrates between heavily visited and pristine shores, suggesting that macroinvertebrates were adversely affected by visitors' impact at heavily visited shores. The test of changes in species richness, density, and assemblage structure from high to low seasons yielded mixed results. The significant changes in density and assemblage structure from high to low seasons were only observed in one heavily visited shore. A significant reduction in size of striped barnacles was observed only in one heavily visited shore. The opportunistic or fugitive species (e.g., small macroalgae and barnacles) were dominant macroinvertebrates on heavily visited shores indicating early succession stage. The results presented here showed that macroinvertebrates were adversely affected by human activities in subtropical rocky shore.","Invertebrates","Tourism","IRN","Asia","4831_Invertebrates","Harmful"
"4832","Arid vegetation in disequilibrium with livestock grazing: evidence from long-term exclosures","SILCOCK JENNY L;FENSHAM ROD J",2013,"In recent decades, the conventional equilibrium paradigm for explaining rangeland vegetation dynamics has been challenged. Proponents of an alternative non-equilibrium paradigm argue that in variable rangeland environments, external climatic events are critical to vegetation dynamics and there is little opportunity for plantherbivore interactions to reach equilibrium. Understanding which paradigm more effectively describes an ecosystem has important consequences for management. In particular, some authors have argued that a focus on reducing stocking rates in non-equilibrium systems may be futile, and management should be opportunistic in response to unpredictable rainfall events. We measured herbaceous biomass and plant species richness and abundance at five 14-year exclosures on innamincka regional reserve. Four were situated in the dunefields land system, and one on the cooper creek floodplain. We did not detect any significant differences between grazed and ungrazed treatments in total species richness or abundance, life form richness or abundance, or herbaceous biomass. Only one species, portulaca oleracea, showed differences in abundance between treatments at more than one site, but the direction of these differences was not consistent. These results suggest that the non-equilibrium paradigm more accurately describes vegetation dynamics in the dunefields and floodplains of north-eastern south australia. It is possible that some species had been lost from the study area prior to the establishment of the exclosures, thereby precluding recovery with protection from grazing; however, a regional analysis of the flora reveals little evidence of this. We argue that the dominance of ephemeral species confers resilience by limiting the development of strong feedbacks between grazing intensity and vegetation dynamics. Current grazing practices seem consistent with the conservation of plant species diversity across the dunefields and floodplains. Future studies should focus on the impacts of cattle grazing on areas of the landscape dominated by palatable perennials, as well as the small number of rare and potentially grazing-sensitive species identified.","Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Trade","AUS","Oceania","4832_Plants/Trees/Shrubs","Not significant or unclear"
"4850","The impact of an invasive exotic bush on the stopover ecology of migrant passerines","ARIZAGA J;UNAMUNO E;CLARABUCH O;AZKONA A",2013,"Migration is highly energy-demanding and birds often need to accumulate large fuel loads during this period. However, original habitat at stopover sites could be affected by invasive exotic plants outcompeting native vegetation. The impact of exotic plants on the stopover behavior of migrant bird species is poorly understood. As a general hypothesis, it can be supposed that habitat change due to the presence of exotic plants will affect migrants, having a negative impact on bird abundance, on avian community assemblage, and/or on fuel deposition rate. To test these predictions, we used data obtained in august 2011 at a ringing station in a coastal wetland in northern iberia which contained both unaltered reedbeds (phragmites spp.) And areas where the reedbeds had been largely replaced by the invasive saltbush (baccharis halimifolia). Passerines associated with reedbeds during the migration period were used as model species, with a particular focus on sedge warblers (acrocephalus schoenobaenus). The saltbush promoted a noticeable change on bird assemblage, which became enriched by species typical of woodland habitats. Sedge warblers departed with a higher fuel load, showed a higher fuel deposition rate, and stayed for longer in the control zone than in the invaded zone. Invasive plants, such as saltbush, can impose radical changes on habitat, having a direct effect on the stopover strategies of migrants. The substitution of reedbeds by saltbushes in several coastal marshes in atlantic europe should be regarded as a problem with potential negative consequences for the conservation of migrant bird species associated with this habitat.","Birds","Species Dispersal","ESP","Europe","4850_Birds","Beneficial"

Saltmarshes are under threat from sea level rise, landward migration of mangroves, and in urban regions from habitat loss, input of litter, nutrients, and other contaminants. In urbanised catchments, saltmarsh areas receive nutrient-enriched and pollutant-contaminated run-off, such as heavy metals, through the stormwater system. This study aimed to investigate the impact of urban stormwater on saltmarsh and mangrove species composition and distribution. To test the effect of stormwater run-off in urbanised catchments on saltmarsh communities, we analysed the soil for pollutant elements, salinity and nutrient concentration and recorded vegetation composition at eight sites in the sydney region, australia. We found that elevated total nitrogen (> 0.4 wt%) and reduced salinity of the soil downslope of stormwater outlets facilitates establishment of exotic plants and might promote migration of mangroves into saltmarshes, resulting in a squeezing effect on the distribution of saltmarsh vegetation. Saltmarsh cover was significantly lower below stormwater outlets and exotic plant cover increased significantly with sediment calcium concentrations above 8840 mg/kg, which are associated with stormwater runoff. However, this effect was found to be strongest in highly industrialised areas compared to residential areas. Understanding the impact of pollutants on coastal wetlands will improve management strategies for the conservation of this important endangered ecological community. (C) 2018 elsevier b.v.

Comparisons between disturbed and undisturbed forest community were conducted using two-way indicator species analysis (twinspan) and detrended correspondence analysis (dca). The twinspan analysis identified 13 association types from 76 total samples collected. The dca correlation analysis showed that forest community was significantly affected by physiographical factors (such as elevation and slope) in the undisturbed region; however, that was correlated with not only physiographical factors but also intensity of tourism, and the effect of tourism disturbance was stronger than that of physiographical factors in the disturbed regions. In addition, some indicator species were discovered.

These birds can provide ecosystem services, such as pest control, that improve agricultural yields whilst minimising the use of agrochemicals. This study quantified avian biodiversity in rice production landscapes during three farming stages in peninsular malaysia. In malaysia, rice fields can be an important habitat for migrating birds due to malaysia's position on the east-asian-australasian flyway. We determined bird abundance, species richness, and composition in rice field landscapes and compared these during different stages of rice growing. Wetland and terrestrial birds were counted in rice fields using the point-count method. Sixty sampling points were randomly established in three locations, from which 3447 individual birds of 46 species and 26 families were recorded. There was a significant difference in total bird abundance and species richness between the three different stages of rice growing. The growing stage supported greater bird abundance and species richness compared to the pre-harvest and post-harvest stages. Rice-growing provides temporary habitats to different bird species in this managed aquatic landscape. This implies the presence of abundant food, such as small fish and amphibians. The evidence from this study suggests that biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices should be implemented to improve habitat quality for birds in rice production landscapes.","Birds","Trade","MYS","Asia","518_Birds","Changed"

The abundance of farmland birds is one important element of this biodiversity. At the end of the 20th century, member states of the european union (eu) experienced serious population declines of farmland birds due to agricultural intensification, which was not observed in the eastern european nonmember states. In 2004, 10 mostly eastern european countries acceded to the eu. It is thus important to ask whether this historical step resulted in changes of agricultural production and, in turn, in farmland bird populations. Here we used annual crop yields and monitoring data on farmland bird abundance in an eastern european new eu-member state and showed that agricultural production intensified and farmland bird populations declined steeply after country's eu accession. These results indicate that entering eu's common agricultural policy caused significant deterioration of farmland biodiversity in a once biodiversity-rich region.","Birds","Trade","CZE","Europe","5314_Birds","Harmful"

This sac harbours a high diversity of invertebrate communities, and it is located in a very touristy area of the littoral of malaga and within the limits of one of the most productive shellfish fishing areas of the nw alboran sea. Here, the artisanal fishery targeting molluscs is a locally important activity because some species (e.g. Chamelea gallina, callista chione, donax trunculus) are highly demanded by locals and touristsand therefore reaching high commercial value. More than 200 molluscan species inhabit the soft bottoms of the sac calahonda, from which eight species collected in this study have economic value. The bivalve c. Gallina was the most abundant and frequent commercial species, mainly at shallow fine and medium sand bottoms, followed by c. Chione at coarse sand bottoms. Some species displayed higher abundance values of large or small size individuals at different depths, and most of them showed maximum abundances in spring and summer. Many invertebrate species associated with these soft bottoms are potentially very sensitive to dredging activities, especially echinoderms, decapods and cnidarians.

In recent decades, invasive plants, such as russian olive (elaeagnus angustifolia), have achieved broad distribution and local dominance in many western riparian areas, raising concerns over the loss of ecological function within these systems. In 2005 and 2006 we conducted avian point counts and surveyed vegetation cover at 95 points along the snake and columbia rivers in southeastern washington to investigate the effects of total woody vegetation cover and the relative proportion of russian olive cover on breeding and wintering riparian bird communities. Our results indicated that riparian habitats dominated by russian olive can support diverse and abundant bird communities, though cavity nesting species were noticeably sparse. Bird density and species richness were best explained by a quadratic relationship to total woody vegetation cover in both seasons, as was breeding bird community composition, with greatest density and richness in intermediate cover levels. We found no indication that the proportion of the woody vegetation comprised of russian olive strongly influenced any of these bird community metrics. Given that russian olive comprised 81.6% of the riparian vegetation in our study area, it is unclear from our results how russian olive would affect bird communities in regions where native vegetation is more abundant. Regardless, complete eradication of russian olive from riparian systems where the plant is a major component will reduce the overall habitat value for birds by eliminating significant structural complexity.","Birds","Species Dispersal;Knowledge Transfer","USA","North America","5577_Birds","Not significant or unclear"

We monitored site use by waterbirds at lake chapala, the largest lake in mexico and recently designated ramsar site, to evaluate the potential influence of water hyacinth cover on species composition and aggregate measures of the waterbird community, including waterbird density, species richness, and simpson's index of diversity. We examined the response of waterbirds to changes in percent water hyacinth cover at 22 independent sites around the lake during six study seasons from may 2006 to february 2008. We found little evidence to suggest that percent water hyacinth cover affected aggregate community measures; however, multivariate analysis of relative species composition suggested that water hyacinth cover corresponded with seasonal species composition (canonical correspondence r = 0.66, p = 0.007) when seasonal site cover averaged 17.7 +/- 4.67% (winter 2007). Several migratory species were not observed during this season, which could suggest that some small-bodied migratory species avoided lake chapala during the winter of high water hyacinth cover. We suspect that observed changes in the waterbird community are in response to species-specific tolerances for water hyacinth and indirect abiotic and biotic effects of its presence (e.g., invertebrate and fish composition).","Birds","Species Dispersal","MEX","North America","5746_Birds","Not significant or unclear"

We use a combination of line-transect surveys in 2002 and 2009 (n = 540 km) and ethnographic interviews (n = 210) to investigate changes in the status of cerco-pithecines and colobines at rds, with additional comparisons to earlier work. This protected area was lightly logged in the 1970s and the park was gazetted in 1990, with multiple-use reserve sectors allocated. Since the park's inception, hunting and the trade of primates have increased, along with human migration, greater accessibility of arms, and reduction of preferred ungulate prey. Primates have declined in both the park and reserve sectors. Our data further suggest that at rds hunting has had a greater impact on primate diversity and abundance than logging. We have identified changes in species-specific vulnerability to hunting over time, with cercopithecus nictitans and lophocebus albigena initially having appeared to be relatively resistant to hunting pressure in 2002. However, subsequently as gun hunting has increased at rds, these species have become vulnerable. Although monkeys at rds have been responding behaviorally to increased gun hunting, they are not able to keep pace with changing hunting practices. This study allows us to begin to understand synergistic impacts of hunting and logging, necessary if we are to recommend strategies to better secure the future of primates in multiuse protected areas.

The intention was to detect all the great bustards present in the study area. The great bustard population in castilla y leon during the breeding season of 2008 was 14,025 birds: 5,637 males, 7,760 females and 628 individuals whose sex could not be determined. The population was 34% greater in 2008 than in 1998 when the area surveyed in both censuses is compared. Population increases were recorded in all provinces except for soria, where no birds were observed. Not all local populations within provinces increased: we detected population declines of over 10% in 43 (27%) of the 160 polygons surveyed both in 1998 and 2008, population increases of over 10%. In 93 (58%) polygons, and largely stable populations (changes less than 10%) in 24 (15%) polygons. Provincial increases in bustard numbers were positively correlated with increases in the extent of unirrigated legume crops. The great bustard population in castilla y leon in 2008 was the largest in the world, accounting for 27-32% of the global population and about 47% of the estimated spanish population. The spread of unirrigated legumes, crops that are promoted by agri-environment schemes, may have fostered the observed population increase between 1998 and 2008.

We analyzed data from a 17-year study of the distribution of the non-native argentine ant (linepithema humile) and the native winter ant (prenolepis imparis) in a preserve in northern california (u.s.a.). We conducted logistic regressions and used model selection to determine whether the following variables were associated with changes in the distribution of each species: presence of conspecifics at neighboring sites, distance to development (e.g., roads, buildings, and landscaped areas), proportion of vegetation cover taller than 0.75 m, elevation, distance to water, presence of both species at a site, temperature, and rainfall. Argentine ants colonized unoccupied sites from neighboring sites, but the probability of appearance and persistence decreased as distance to development, vegetation cover, and elevation increased. Winter ants appeared and persisted in sites with relatively high vegetation cover (i.e., highly shaded sites). Presence of the 2 species was negatively associated in sites with high vegetation cover (more winter ants) and sites near development (more argentine ants). Probability of colonization of argentine ants decreased where winter ants were most persistent. At sites near development within the preserve, abundant argentine ant populations may be excluding winter ants. The high abundance of argentine ants at these sites may be due to immigration from suburban areas outside the preserve, which are high-quality habitat for argentine ants. In the interior of the preserve, distance from development, low-quality habitat, and interaction with winter ants may in combination exclude argentine ants. Interactions among the variables we examined were associated with low probabilities of argentine ant colonization in the preserve.","Invertebrates","Species Dispersal","USA","North America","5804_Invertebrates","Harmful"

Our understanding of how broad social phenomena (e.g. Socioeconomic development) affect the diversity and function of coral reef fish assemblages however, is still poor. Here, we use structural equation models to reveal how human population density, socioeconomic development, and market access affect fishing pressure and coral cover to, in turn, explain the diversity and biomass of key functional groups of reef fish assemblages within solomon islands. Fishing pressure is predominantly driven by both market access and local population density, and has a clear negative effect on the diversity and function of coral reef fishes. The strong positive effect of market access on fishing pressure makes clear the importance of understanding social-ecological linkages in the context of increasingly connected societies. This study highlights the need to address broad social phenomena rather than focusing on proximate threats such as fishing pressure, to ensure the continued flow of coral reef goods and services in this time of rapid global social and environmental change.

There, the turtles encounter a range of fisheries, including the brazilian driftnet fishery targeting hammerhead sharks. From 2002 to 2008, 351 sea turtles were incidentally caught in 41 fishing trips and 371 sets. Leatherbacks accounted for 77.3% of the take (n = 252 turtles, capture rate = 0.1405 turtles/km of net), followed by loggerheads caretta caretta (47 individuals, capture rate = 0.0262 turtles/km of net), green turtles chelonia mydas (27 individuals, capture rate = 0.0151 turtles/km of net) and unidentified hard-shelled turtles (25 individual, capture rate = 0.0139 turtles/km of net) that fell off the net during hauling. Immediate mortality (i.e., turtles that were dead upon reaching the vessel, excluding post-release mortality) was similar among the species and accounted for 22.2 to 29.4% of turtles hauled onboard. The annual catch by this fishery ranged from 1,212 to 6,160 leatherback turtles, as estimated based on bootstrap procedures under different fishing effort scenarios in the 1990s. The present inertia in law and enforcement regarding gillnet regulations in brazil could result in the reestablishment of the driftnet fishery, driving rates of leatherback mortality to levels similar to those observed in previous decades. This development could potentially lead to the collapse of the south atlantic leatherback population, mirroring the decline of the species in the pacific. In light of these potential impacts and similar threats to other pelagic mega fauna, we recommend banning this type of fishery in the region.","Reptiles","Trade","BRA","South America","5875_Reptiles","Not significant or unclear"

A multivariate analysis showed close relationships: the maritime traffic disturbance and the food quality and availability drive the spatial differences of the assemblages, dividing the area into three sub-areas: the area near the boate torrent that empties into the harbour, the harbour proper, and the external area (just outside the harbour). Macro- and meiofauna showed notably different temporal trends, indicating competition for the resources and the higher sensitivity of the macrofauna to environmental pressures. The macrofauna strongly decreased as a response to heavier harbour activities, with increasing turbidity also affecting the external station outside the harbour. Finally, comparing the macrofaunal communities to those sampled in the same area 10 years before, we found that their abundance, richness and biomass had notably decreased, highlighting the worsening of the harbour environment due to the increased organic load and turbidity.

We also evaluated fish introductions by different mechanisms such as aquaculture, angling and the aquarium trade in the homogenization of fish assemblages. The relative importance of native extinctions in the homogenization process was assessed by simulating the exclusion of threatened species in the data set. Location parana river, south-eastern south america. Methods a fish species list of the parana river basin was organized in a subset of species distributions, according to pre- and post-introductions caused by the elimination of the natural barrier and by other mechanisms. Biotic homogenization was verified by the use of jaccard's and bray-curtis's coefficients, whittaker's beta diversity index, non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (nmds) and nonparametric tests. Results for all subsets of species distributions, we observed an increase in the number of non-native species in common related to the introductions. Between 40 and 52% of the species currently present in the upper parana basin dispersed upstream from the lower parana after the construction of itaipu dam, including at least 1 class, 2 orders, 4 families and 16 genera of fish. Jaccard's coefficient between the upper and lower parana river increased by 6-7.5% only considering the itaipu dam influence and 10.5% considering all mechanisms of fish introductions. More than 50% of the increase in similarity was caused by the elimination of the barrier. Our results indicated functional homogenization related to large-bodied siluriformes (catfish). Main conclusions itaipu lake flooded a natural barrier and allowed hydrologic connectivity between the upper and lower parana river, and many fishes of the lower part of the river were able to colonize the upper stretches. The homogenization of the two assemblages between these adjacent aquatic regions was an unpredicted result of hydropower implementation. Introductions by dam can also shift longitudinal and latitudinal body size patterns (i.e. Bergmann's rule).","Fish","Water Transfer","BRA;PRY;ARG;BOL;URY","South America","5966_Fish","Mixed"

Many tourist destinations and religious enclaves in developing countries are inside protected areas (pa). They are well connected by roads and attract thousands of visitors. The effect of such large human congregations inside pa on biodiversity is not well understood. Here, we address the impacts of increased vehicular traffic due to religious tourism on local fauna inside the kalakad mundanthurai tiger reserve in south india. We sampled sections of surfaced roads for mortalities before and during an annual festival across three habitats in 2008 and 2009. Millipedes, anurans, insects and reptiles dominated the mortalities and mammals avoided the roads. A total of 1413 individuals belonging to 56 species were killed on roads. Nocturnal species constituted 50% of these mortalities and 64% of the species composition. There was a 299% increase in road mortalities and 648% increase in nocturnal species mortality during the festival compared to those before the festival. Mean mortalities varied across habitats and were highest in moist deciduous forests. Mortalities were influenced significantly by vehicular traffic rather than rainfall. Indications of a temporary local extinction were evident beyond certain threshold of vehicular movement. The number of vehicles plying on the roads was three times higher than the threshold level as determined in this study. The festival also had a spillover effect by causing increased mortalities on roads not connected to the temple. We discuss several strategies to minimize impacts due to large scale vehicular movement inside protected areas. (C) 2011 elsevier b.v.

This is particularly concerning in many protected areas because the increase of recreational activities requiring the use of vehicles. Effects of roads and traffic within guild scenarios and ecological processes remain however poorly known. Here we examined how road proximity and traffic intensity influence patterns of resource use in an old-world avian scavenger guild living in a protected natural park in northern spain. We experimentally placed 130 carcasses at different distances from a scenic road in the centre of the park. Vehicleswere recorded bymeans of traffic counterswhich revealed that maximumnumbers were reached during weekends and holidays and during themiddle hours of the day. Avian scavenger attendance at carcasses was recorded by means of camera-traps. Obligated scavengers, eurasian griffon (gyps fulvus) and egyptian vultures (neophron percnopterus) were frequently observed (59.4% and 37.7% of the consumed carcasses) together with five other facultative scavenger species. We found that the richness (number of species) and the probability of consumption of the resource were reduced the smaller the distance to the road and in dayswith higher traffic intensity. The same factors affected the probability of presence of all the scavenger species. Moreover, some of them, notably griffon vultures, showed hourly patterns of carcass attendance suggesting avoidance of maximum traffic levels. Our results highlight that roads and traffic would trigger consequences on the structure and functioning of scavenger food webs, which may be particularly concerning in protected areas with remarkable levels of biodiversity. Future regulations at protected areas should couple both traffic and tourist affluencewithwildlife conservation. In this way important ecological processes would be preserved while maintaining a good dissemination of natural values. (C) 2018 elsevier b.v.

In st lucia, construction of tourism infrastructure in the coastal dry forest threatens the endangered white-breasted thrasher ramphocinclus brachyurus. Long-term protection of habitat is vital, but design of such conservation action is constrained by lack of data on the species' distribution and population responses to habitat change and fragmentation. Distance sampling surveys were conducted in 2006 and 2007 to estimate numbers and map the distribution of the two remaining sub-populations. White-breasted thrashers in st lucia were estimated to number around 1,200 individuals, with roughly 1,050 birds occupying just over 600 ha of dry forest in the mandele area. We demonstrate that tourist development companies will likely soon own land constituting around 40% of the species' extent of occurrence on st lucia, and nearly 35% globally, and that ongoing and planned tourist developments threaten around one third of the st lucian white-breasted thrasher population. Given the size of these potential impacts, it is vital that patches of dry forest to the west and north of a development site in the mandele area are safeguarded. These sites support white-breasted thrashers at high density and are contiguous with an existing forest reserve.

The freshwater aquarium trade provides economic and livelihood opportunities to the rural poor, but has been implicated in biodiversity loss through population declines and local extirpation of high-value endemic species. Previous observations on population declines are largely based on anecdotal data, however, and there are no studies on the population dynamics or stock assessment of freshwater fish species collected for the aquarium pet trade. 2. To understand how wild collection of endemic and threatened species for the aquarium trade could affect their populations, the sustainability of collecting the endangered redline torpedo barb (sahyadria denisonii), and its evolutionarily distinct lineages (henceforth rltbs), from the western ghats region (part of the western ghats-sri lanka biodiversity hot spot) for the aquarium trade was studied to provide baseline data to inform conservation action. 3. Local populations of rltbs at the five commercial collection sites showed high mortality rates, and fish were exploited before they attained sexual maturity. The unmanaged fishery has led to unsustainable levels of exploitation, and populations of rltbs at three sites are vulnerable to an impending collapse. 4. Endemic and threatened freshwater fish species used in the aquarium pet trade are exposed to local extirpations and global extinctions unless management plans and legislative controls are implemented and strictly enforced. Management plans and conservation actions to help guide the responsible fisheries of rltbs are suggested, and the wider implications of unmanaged exploitation of endemic aquarium fisheries are discussed.","Fish","Trade","IND","Asia","708_Fish","Harmful"

Recreational ecosystem services like wildlife tourism are specific cultural ecosystem services that often involve relationships between the supply of opportunities to interact with biodiversity and the demand of wildlife tourists. Here, we first investigated whether different biodiversity measures based on three metrics applied to four components of large mammal diversity influenced the distribution of visitors within four protected areas (pas) in southern africa. Second, we explored whether these effects were context-specific across the four pas. We counted large mammals and visitor numbers along 196 road transects to test these relationships. All species-mammal diversity metrics related positively to visitor numbers. Subsets of mammal diversity were also positively associated with the distribution of visitors in all pas. Relationships between supply and demand for the recreational service of wildlife tourism were mainly context-specific: the relationships between biodiversity measures and visitor numbers differed among pas. Our results could help managers to optimize the use of recreational services within pas, by diversifying viewing opportunities while reducing disturbance to wildlife.

"813","Invasion of aquarium origin soft corals on a tropical rocky reef in the southwest atlantic, brazil","MANTELATTO MARCELO CHECOLI;DA SILVA AMANDA GUILHERME;LOUZADA TAYANA DOS SANTOS;MCFADDEN CATHERINE S;CREED JOEL CHRISTOPHER",2018,"Non-indigenous species (nis) can cause substantial change in ecosystems and as marine invasives they can become a major threat to coastal and subtidal habitats. In september 2017 previously unknown and apparently nis soft corals were detected on a shallow subtidal tropical rocky reef at ilha grande bay, southeast brazil. The present study aims to identify the species, quantify their distribution, abundance, and their interactions with native species. The most abundant nis belonged to the recently described genus sansibia (family xeniidae) and the less common species was identified as clavularia cf. Viridis (family clavulariidae). They were found along 170 m of shoreline at all depths where hard substrate was available. Sansibia sp. Dominated deeper communities, associated positively with some macroalgal and negatively with the zoantharian palythoa caribaeonon, which probably provided greater biotic resistance to invasion. Both species are of indo-pacific origin and typical of those ornamentals found in the aquarium trade.","Invertebrates","Trade;Species Dispersal","BRA","South America","813_Invertebrates","Harmful"
"826","Efficiency of conservation areas to protect orchid species in benin, west africa","ASSEDE E S P;DJAGOUN C A M S;AZIHOU F A;GOGAN Y S C;KOUTON M D;ADOMOU A C;GELDENHUYS C J;CHIRWA P W;SINSIN B",2018,"The effectiveness of protected areas to guarantee future conservation of several plant species remains questionable. This study was carried out in the biosphere reserve of pendjari (brp) and surrounding unprotected areas to assess the efficiency of the reserve to conserve orchids. A total of 90 plots (52 in protected areas; 38 in unprotected areas) were sampled. The recorded data include: orchid species, number of individuals per species, the height and diameter at breast height of host trees. Diversity indices were used to assess the orchid diversity in the protected and unprotected areas. Preferred habitat conditions of orchid species were investigated using constrained correspondence analysis. An independent t-test and two-way analysis of valiance were performed to assess an existing combined effect of vegetation type and the conservation status on the density of orchid spedes. The importance value index (ivi) was used to measure how dominant an orchid species is in a given zone according to the conservation status of the zone. Only three epiphytic orchids (calyptrochilum christyanum, cyrtorchis arcuata and plectrelminthus caudatus) were recorded and all in gallery forest of unprotected areas. Indeed, 67% and 58% of the orchid species were only recorded in unprotected areas and in gallery forest, respectively. There was no significant difference between the density of all recorded orchids in protected and unprotected areas. The conservation status of the studied zone had a significant effect on the densities of nervilia kotschyi and eulophia guineensis (p < 0.0001). The highest ivi of n. Kostchyi was observed in the protected area and of e. Guineensis was in the unprotected area. This first effort to compile a reference list of the orchid species of the brp showed that some orchid species were well represented within the protected area, but all of the epiphytic orchids were recorded from unprotected areas. A representative gap can be assumed to exist for most epiphytic orchids only recorded in the gallery forests of unprotected areas. Our results highlighted the need to redefine protective management strategies for orchid species in the brp. (C) 2018 saab. Published by elsevier b.v.

"84","Spatiotemporal effects of logging and fire on tall, wet temperate eucalypt forest birds","LINDENMAYER DAVID B;BLANCHARD WADE;BLAIR DAVID;WESTGATE MARTIN J;SCHEELE BEN C",2019,"Forests globally are subject to disturbances such as logging and fire that create complex temporal variation in spatial patterns of forest cover and stand age. However, investigations that quantify temporal changes in biodiversity in response to multiple forms of disturbance in space and time are relatively uncommon. Over a 10-yr period, we investigated the response of bird species to spatiotemporal changes in forest cover associated with logging and wildfire in the mountain ash (eucalyptus regnans) forests of southeastern australia. Specifically, we examined how bird occurrence changed with shifts in the proportion of area burned or logged in a 4.5 km radius surrounding our 88 long-term field survey sites, each measuring 1 ha in size. Overall species richness was greatest in older forest patches, but declined as the amount of fire around each site increased. At the individual species level, 31 of the 37 bird species we modeled exhibited a negative response to the amount of fire in the surrounding landscape, while one species responded positively to fire. Only nine species exhibited signs of recovery in the 6 yr of surveys following the fire. Five species were more likely to be detected as the proportion of logged forest surrounding a site increased, suggesting a possible ""concentration effect"" with displaced birds moving into unlogged areas following harvesting of adjacent areas. We also identified relationships between the coefficients of life history attributes and spatiotemporal changes in forest cover and stand age. Large-bodied birds and migratory species were associated with landscapes subject to large amounts of fire in 2009. There were associations between old growth stands and small-bodied bird species and species that were not insectivores. Our study shows that birds in mountain ash forests are strongly associated with old growth stands and exhibit complex, time-dependent, and species-specific responses to landscape disturbance. Despite logging and fire both being high-severity perturbations, no bird species exhibited similar responses to fire and logging in the landscape surrounding our sites. Thus, species responses to one kind of landscape-scale disturbance are not readily predictable based on an understanding of the responses to another kind of (albeit superficially similar) disturbance.","Birds","Trade","AUS","Oceania","84_Birds","Not significant or unclear"

"992","disentangling the response of lake littoral invertebrate assemblages to multiple pressures","JOHNSON RICHARD K;HALLSTAN SIMON;ZHAO XUEMIN",2018,"lakes are affected by a number of anthropogenic pressures, often resulting in biodiversity loss and impairment of ecosystem services. here we analysed responses of littoral invertebrate assemblages in 589 temperate lakes to five anthropogenic pressures and combined pressure load. over half of the lakes (n = 302) were deemed to be affected by one or more pressures. the most pervasive pressures were forestry (73% of the impacted lakes), agriculture (21%) and acidification (11%). individually, agriculture and ph explained > 20% of the among-lake variability in littoral invertebrate assemblages. ranking the importance of the five pressures on littoral invertebrate assemblages, after accounting for covariance with natural factors and other pressures, showed that acidity > agriculture > forestry > urbanization >= invasive species. although about 10% of the lakes were acidified according to chemical criteria, our finding that acidity was ranked first is partly due to the naturally low ph of humic boreal lakes, and not acidification per se. comparison of species composition to cumulative pressure load revealed no clear patterns. species composition (ca axis 1 scores) in lakes with one or more pressures differed from sites with no pressures, but cumulative pressure effects were non-significant. a significant three-pressure impact was found for species composition characterized by ca axis 2 scores, related to the combined pressures of agriculture, invasive species and urbanization. collectively, our results show that littoral invertebrate assemblages respond uniquely to several different pressures, underpinning their use as a biomonitoring tool for assessing the ecological status of lakes. ranking the effects of individual pressures as done here is a critical step in designing and implementing measures to protect and mitigate anthropogenic effects on biodiversity loss.","Invertebrates","Species Dispersal","SWE","Europe","992_Invertebrates","Not significant or unclear"
