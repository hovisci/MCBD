Biomonitoring of the disturbed area and a control station shows that elevated temperature is a more significant stressor compared to salinity, thus causing a decrease in abundance and richness. Critical temperature thresholds were observed at 30 and 35 degrees c, the latter representing the most thermally tolerant species in the studied area pararotalia calcariformata, which is the only symbiont-bearing species observed within the core of the heated area. Common species of the shallow hard-bottom habitats including several lessepsian invaders are almost absent in the most exposed site indicating that excess warming will likely impede the survival of these species that currently benefit from the ongoing warming of the eastern mediterranean.

3,3,109,All,not vetted,3924,The role of fragmentation and landscape changes in the ecological release of common nest predators in the neotropics,COVE MICHAEL V;MANUEL SPINOLA R;JACKSON VICTORIA L;SAENZ JOEL C,2014,"Loss of large mammalian carnivores may allow smaller mesopredators to become abundant and threaten other community members. There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

In order to bioassay water quality and aquatic health analysis using diversity indices. Species richness values of 15, 15, 18 and 31, evenness values of 0.78, 0.82, 0.78, and 0.71, shannon-wiener index values of 3.06, 3.04, 3.25 and 5.63, and simpson's index values of 0.133, 0.117, 0.100, and 0.074 were determined for macroinvertebrates. In the present study, low diversity indices, like the shannon-wiener index, demonstrated that the lake is polluted and poor health status. Taungthaman lake supports a highly productive freshwater capture/culture fishery and also an important tourist attraction. Although the lake is highly valuable in its natural state, it is also highly vulnerable to the impact of external factors. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent and conservation management of aquatic environment of lake health."
7,7,21,Anna,not vetted,2567,Land use biodiversity impacts embodied in international food trade,CHAUDHARY ABHISHEK;KASTNER THOMAS,2016,"Agricultural land use to meet the demands of a growing population, changing diets, lifestyles and biofuel production is a significant driver of biodiversity loss. Globally applicable methods are needed to assess biodiversity impacts hidden in internationally traded food items. We used the countryside species area relationship (sar) model to estimate the mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles species lost (i.e. Species 'committed to extinction') due to agricultural land use within each of the 804 terrestrial ecoregion. These species lost estimates were combined with high spatial resolution global maps of crop yields to calculate species lost per ton for 170 crops in 184 countries. Finally, the impacts per ton were linked with the bilateral trade data of crop products between producing and consuming countries from fao, to calculate the land use biodiversity impacts embodied in international crop trade and consumption. We found that 83% of total species loss is incurred due to agriculture land use devoted for domestic consumption whereas 17% is due to export production. Exports from indonesia to usa and china embody highest impacts (20 species lost at the regional level each). In general, industrialized countries with high per capita gdp tend to be major net importers of biodiversity impacts from developing tropical countries. Results show that embodied land area is not a good proxy for embodied biodiversity impacts in trade flows, as crops occupying little global area such as sugarcane, palm oil, rubber and coffee have disproportionately high biodiversity impacts.

8,8,23,Anna,not vetted,2613,Assessing species traits and landscape relationships of the mammalian carnivore community in a neotropical biological corridor,VARGAS LAIN E PARDO;COVE MICHAEL V;MANUEL SPINOLA R;CAMILO DE LA CRUZ JUAN;SAENZ JOEL C,2016,"Mammalian carnivores play an important role in regulating food webs and ecosystems. While many carnivore populations are facing various threats such as habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and illegal trade, others have adapted to human-dominated landscapes. Information about neotropical carnivore communities in particular is limited, especially in disturbed landscapes. We conducted a camera trap survey at 38 sites across the san juan-la selva biological corridor in costa rica to assess occupancy and detection probabilities of the carnivore community. We developed hypotheses within a likelihood-based framework in order to determine the landscape features and species traits (diet and size) that influenced their occupancy. We detected nine of the 13 native carnivores predicted to occur in the corridor. When modeled separately, each species responded to land cover changes differently, suggesting no strong community-wide predictors of occupancy. We then modeled three separate guilds within the carnivore community: omnivorous mesopredators, obligate carnivorous mesopredators, and apex predators. These community guild models revealed a negative relationship between omnivorous mesopredators and increasing forest and tree plantation cover, suggesting omnivores utilize forest fragments and edge habitats in agricultural landscapes. Obligate carnivorous mesopredator models did not reveal any strong habitat relationships, but landscape effects tended to contradict our a priori predictions. Apex predators were positively associated with increasing forest and tree plantation cover, protected areas, and increasing distances to villages. Alarmingly, apex predators and obligate carnivorous mesopredators were generally rare within the biological corridor. A lack of top-down control alone might result in heightened occupancy for all mesopredators, but because the community is dominated by omnivorous species, bottom-up release from human-induced land cover changes and resource provision may better explain their high occupancy."
9,9,38,Anna,not vetted,4087,Assessment of bird response to the migratory bird habitat initiative using weather-surveillance radar,SIEGES MASON L;SMOLINSKY JACLYN A;BALDWIN MICHAEL J;BARROW WYLIE C JR;RANDALL LORI A;BULER JEFFREY J,2014,"In response to the deepwater horizon oil spill in spring 2010, the natural resources conservation service implemented the migratory bird habitat initiative (mbhi) to provide temporary wetland habitat for migrating and wintering waterfowl, shorebirds, and other birds along the northern gulf of mexico via managed flooding of agricultural lands. We used weather-surveillance radar to conduct broad regional assessments of bird response to mbhi activities within the mississippi alluvial valley and the west gulf coastal plain. Across both regions, birds responded positively to mbhi management by exhibiting greater relative bird densities within sites relative to pre-management conditions in prior years and relative to surrounding non-flooded agricultural lands. Bird density at mbhi sites was generally greatest during winter for both regions. Unusually high flooding in the years prior to implementation of the mbhi confounded detection of overall changes in remotely sensed soil wetness across sites. The magnitude of bird response at mbhi sites compared to prior years and to non-flooded agricultural lands was generally related to the surrounding landscape context: proximity to areas of high bird density, amount of forested wetlands, emergent marsh, non-flooded agriculture, or permanent open water. However, these relationships varied in strength and direction between regions and seasons, a finding which we attribute to differences in seasonal bird composition and broad regional differences in landscape configuration and composition. We detected greater increases in relative bird use at sites in closer proximity to areas of high bird density during winter in both regions. Additionally, bird density was greater during winter at sites with more emergent marsh in the surrounding landscape. Thus, bird use of managed wetlands could be maximized by enrolling lands located near areas of known bird concentration and within a mosaic of existing wetlands. Weather-radar observations provide strong evidence that mbhi sites located inland from coastal wetlands impacted by the oil spill provided wetland habitat used by a variety of birds."

This perception is based primarily on a few case studies and anecdotal evidence, but a formal analysis of global temporal trends in jellyfish populations has been missing. Here, we analyze all available long-term datasets on changes in jellyfish abundance across multiple coastal stations, using linear and logistic mixed models and effect-size analysis to show that there is norobust evidence for a global increase in jellyfish. Although there has been a small linear increase in jellyfish since the 1970s, this trend was unsubstantiated by effect-size analysis that showed no difference in the proportion of increasing vs. Decreasing jellyfish populations over all time periods examined. Rather, the strongest nonrandom trend indicated jellyfish populations undergo larger, worldwide oscillations with an approximate 20-y periodicity, including a rising phase during the 1990s that contributed to the perception of a global increase in jellyfish abundance. Sustained monitoring is required over the next decade to elucidate with statistical confidence whether the weak increasing linear trend in jellyfish after 1970 is an actual shift in the baseline or part of an oscillation. Irrespective of the nature of increase, given the potential damage posed by jellyfish blooms to fisheries, tourism, and other human industries, our findings foretell recurrent phases of rise and fall in jellyfish populations that society should be prepared to face."

As species ignore national boundaries, unilateral national decisions concerning species trade set the stage for transnational species invasion with significant conservation, economic and political consequences. The need for a coordinated approach to species importation policies is demonstrated by the introduction of two bumblebee species into chile for crop pollination, despite argentina banning commercial importation of alien bumblebees based on expert opinion. The large garden bumblebee, bombus ruderatus, was first introduced in 1982, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, bombus terrestris, has been continually introduced since 1997 as part of the burgeoning bumblebee trade. Both species have subsequently invaded southern south america. Today, the consequences of the growth of the bumblebee trade for agricultural pollination ranks among the top 15 emerging environmental issues likely to affect global diversity. Documented impacts of these invasions include the severe decline and local extinctions of the sole native patagonian bumblebee, bombus dahlbomii, pathogen transmission, flower damage and nectar robbing of native and cultivated plants. Policy implications. The south american bumblebee invasions portrayed here should alert governments to the unintended consequences of the booming international bee trade. More broadly, this case demonstrates that one country's importation decisions can have policy implications for its neighbours without consultation. Regrettably, coordinated international measures to prevent species invasions are seldom considered in south america or elsewhere, despite existing legal frameworks. The bumblebee case and others provide stark evidence of the pressing need for coordinated specific and general international policies concerning global species trade and their implementation."

This sac harbours a high diversity of invertebrate communities, and it is located in a very touristy area of the littoral of malaga and within the limits of one of the most productive shellfish fishing areas of the nw alboran sea. Here, the artisanal fishery targeting molluscs is a locally important activity because some species (e.g. Chamelea gallina, callista chione, donax trunculus) are highly demanded by locals and touristsand therefore reaching high commercial value. More than 200 molluscan species inhabit the soft bottoms of the sac calahonda, from which eight species collected in this study have economic value. The bivalve c. Gallina was the most abundant and frequent commercial species, mainly at shallow fine and medium sand bottoms, followed by c. Chione at coarse sand bottoms. Some species displayed higher abundance values of large or small size individuals at different depths, and most of them showed maximum abundances in spring and summer. Many invertebrate species associated with these soft bottoms are potentially very sensitive to dredging activities, especially echinoderms, decapods and cnidarians. Further research regarding the potential impact of fisheries on these assemblages would be desirable, especially considering the high biodiversity existing within this sac and the increase of tourists in the last years."

Yet, many hydroelectric dams are being built (or planned) in the neotropics, where the high species diversity and lack of basic ecological knowledge provide a major obstacle to understanding the effects of this environmental change, which has been mostly described from the perspective of taxonomic change. However, this approach does not account for biological function. Trait-based analysis provides an alternative approach to bioassessment. We assessed the impact of dam closure on the functional structure of fish communities of a neotropical river by applying trait-based analyses to the response of individual traits aggregated at the assemblage level. Fish data were collected during three distinct time periods (1 year before, 1 year after and 5 years after dam closure), at eight sites located downstream of the dam, in the reservoir, transition zone and upstream. The results indicated that reproduction strategies (migration and parental care) and diet (detritivores) were the trait categories mostly affected by the dam, with the response of downstream assemblages differing from upstream of the dam. A trait-based analysis to the impact of damming on fish communities appears to be a promising approach using an initial descriptive analysis of individual traits and regression models of multiple traits that reflect species' adaptation to the new environment. This study provides both an alternative and complementary approach to taxonomic assessment of impacts from damming, contributing towards a more robust evaluation of the response of fish communities to dams."

Mexico lacks long-term time series to determine trends for major eelgrass populations and has made no conservation efforts. Therefore, we present the first report on the historic presence of this annual coastal ecosystem in two wetlands of the gulf of california (gc), the infiernillo channel (cif, largest z. Marina population inside gc) and concepcion bay (bcp, the only eelgrass population along gc's west coast), combining field surveys (1999-2010), aerial photography (2000-2010), satellite imagery (1972-2005), and published reports (1994-2007). Three parameters were used as indicators of conservation status: shoot density, seed banks, and aerial coverage. Average shoot density in the cif (741 shoots m(-2)) was 3.8 times higher than in bcp (194 shoots m(-2)), and average seed bank density was similar in both wetlands (17,442 seeds m(-2) vs. 17,000 seeds m(-2)). Opportunistic seagrass ruppia maritima was observed in both wetlands, with higher abundance in summer when z. Marina disappears due to high water temperatures. Eelgrass coverage was three orders of magnitude greater in the cif (9725 ha) than in bcp (3 ha). The striking difference between these wetlands is the lack of environmental protection for bcp and the protection of the cif by the seri indigenous community, which increases human pressure in the former, putting it at high risk of disappearing. Conservation of eelgrass meadows is not only necessary to preserve their ecosystem services but to insure the survival of migratory populations (pacific brant goose, branta bernicla), endangered species (black turtle, chelonia mydas), and fisheries-related species."
20,20,108,Anna,not vetted,3738,"Positive conservation outcome from religious teachings: changes to subsistence turtle harvest practices at cocos (keeling) islands, indian ocean",MACRAE ISMAIL;WHITING SCOTT,2014,"We document and describe the change in attitudes, hunting behaviour and historic subsistence use of sea turtles by cocos malay people of islamic faith in the cocos (keeling) islands, indian ocean over the last 180 years. We used several lines of evidence including historical documents, scientific journals, archived records and interviews with current and former residents. The results are grouped in two time categories: 1) use of turtles prior to mid-1980s and 2) use of turtles after mid-1980s. Prior to the mid-1980s, turtle meat was popular with muslim residents and was consumed when available and was particularly appreciated during times of ceremony. After the mid-1980s, external influences and improved communication modified islamic teachings and sea turtles were reclassified from halal (permitted as food) to haram (prohibited as food). After the mid-1980s, harvest and the use of turtles decreased to negligible numbers. Although a combination of various events and circumstances may have contributed to this change in harvest practices, changes to islamic teachings were likely to be the main factor. These changes in use appeared to have had a dramatic positive effect on the resident green (chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (eretmochelys imbricata) turtle populations, from what appeared to be harvest-related depressed numbers prior to the 1980s, recovering to abundant numbers after 1999. From a management perspective, this is a positive conservation outcome for sea turtles, at both local and regional (indian ocean) scales."

Oceanic driftnets are considered the main cause of the steep decline in pacific ocean populations of the leatherback sea turtle dermochelys coriacea. The world's largest leatherback population nests in west africa and migrates across the atlantic ocean to feed off the south american coast. There, the turtles encounter a range of fisheries, including the brazilian driftnet fishery targeting hammerhead sharks. From 2002 to 2008, 351 sea turtles were incidentally caught in 41 fishing trips and 371 sets. Leatherbacks accounted for 77.3% of the take (n = 252 turtles, capture rate = 0.1405 turtles/km of net), followed by loggerheads caretta caretta (47 individuals, capture rate = 0.0262 turtles/km of net), green turtles chelonia mydas (27 individuals, capture rate = 0.0151 turtles/km of net) and unidentified hard-shelled turtles (25 individual, capture rate = 0.0139 turtles/km of net) that fell off the net during hauling. Immediate mortality (i.e., turtles that were dead upon reaching the vessel, excluding post-release mortality) was similar among the species and accounted for 22.2 to 29.4% of turtles hauled onboard. The annual catch by this fishery ranged from 1,212 to 6,160 leatherback turtles, as estimated based on bootstrap procedures under different fishing effort scenarios in the 1990s. The present inertia in law and enforcement regarding gillnet regulations in brazil could result in the reestablishment of the driftnet fishery, driving rates of leatherback mortality to levels similar to those observed in previous decades. This development could potentially lead to the collapse of the south atlantic leatherback population, mirroring the decline of the species in the pacific. In light of these potential impacts and similar threats to other pelagic mega fauna, we recommend banning this type of fishery in the region."

Unfortunately, problems of biological invasions in aquatic ecosystems have been largely overlooked and lessons from known disasters are learned slowly, despite that negative effects are frequently detected and reported. Here, we review the available literature to generate a list of invasive species in aquatic ecosystems in china. We summarize five major negative effects caused by invasive species, including habitat damage, community change, pests of agriculture and aquaculture, biodiversity loss, and genetic pollution/extinction. We discuss three major vectors (aquaculture, shipping, and aquarium and ornamental trades) responsible for the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species. Finally, we propose and call for management of vectors responsible for the introduction and spread of invasive species in china."

In accordance to the brazilian national forest inventory (ifn-br), the inventory applies systematic sampling, with 440 clusters containing four crosswise 1 000m(2) plots (20x50m) each, located on a 10x10km grid overlaid to land use map based on classification of spot-4 images from 2005. Within the sample units, all woody individuals of the main stratum (dbh >= 10cm) are measured and collected (fertile and sterile), if not undoubtedly identified in field. Regeneration stratum (height>1.50m; dbh<10cm) is registered in 100m(2) in each sample unit. Floristic sampling includes collection of all fertile trees, shrubs and herbs within the sample unit and in its surroundings. This study performs analysis based on 92 clusters measured in 2008 within an area of 32 320km(2) of mixed ombrophyllous forests with araucaria angustifolia located at the state's high plateau (500m to 1 560m above sea level at 26 degrees 00'-28 degrees 30' s and 49 degrees 13'-51 degrees 23' w). Mean density (dbh >= 10cm) is 578 individuals/ha (ranging from 85/ha to 1 310/ha), mean species richness in measured remnants is 35 (8 to 62), shannon and wiener diversity index (h') varies between 1.05 and 3.48. Despite high total species diversity (364 magnoliophyta, five coniferophyta and one tree fern) and relatively high mean basal area (25.75m(2)/ha, varying from 3.87 to 68.85m(2)/ha), the overwhelming majority of forest fragments are considered highly impacted and impoverished, mostly by logging, burning and extensive cattle farming, turning necessary more efficient protection measures.

Invasive pests and trade have created a two-way linkage, leading to perceptions that african countries are becoming a source of invasive pests in other countries via trade. What phytosanitary measures do african countries have to take therefore to reduce losses in economic and trade opportunities? Another important issue is the ability of african countries to reduce trade-related pest invasions from other countries and the impact of such invasions on african economies and the environment. Management strategies that can reduce the introduction of exotic pests, while not restricting the benefits of trade or causing protective trade barriers, are desirable. This paper reviews linkages between trade and invasive pests and the resulting effects on african agricultural exports, the economy, environment and biodiversity. Strategies and policies to deal with invasive pests, trade and trade barriers and protectionism are reviewed to assess how they may affect or can be used by african countries to address these problems."

We assess whether species listed on annex i of the european union (eu) birds directive, for which eu member states are obliged to implement special conservation measures, differ systematically in their short-term (2001-2012) or long-term (1980-2012) population trends from those of non-annex i species. In both periods, annex i species had more positive trends than non-annex i species, particularly in countries that joined the eu earlier. There were additional signatures of climate change and life history strategy in the trends of species in one or both periods. Within annex i species, long-distance migrants fared significantly worse than other species, suggesting that enhanced protection on the breeding grounds alone may be insufficient for these species. We conclude that the eu's conservation legislation has had a demonstrably positive impact on target species, even during a period in which climate change has significantly affected populations."

We use this data set to analyse: (1) the global distribution; (2) the temporal dynamics; (3) the flows between native and alien ranges; and (4) the key drivers of established alien amphibians and reptiles. Locationworldwide. Methodswe collected geographical records of established amphibians and reptiles from a thorough search across a wide number of sources. We supplemented these data with year of first record, when available. We used descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to analyse taxonomic, spatial and temporal patterns in establishment records and the global flows of alien species. We used generalized linear mixed models to relate spatial variation in the number of established species richness with variables describing geographical, environmental and human factors. Resultsour database covers 86% of the terrestrial area of the world. We identified 78 alien amphibian and 198 alien reptile species established in at least one of our 359 study regions. These figures represent about 1.0% of the extant global amphibian and 1.9% of the extant global reptile species richness. The flows of amphibians were dominated by exchanges between and within north and south america, and within europe (59% of all links). For reptiles, the network of global flows of established alien species was much more diverse, with every continental region being both a donor and a recipient of similar importance. The number of established alien amphibians and reptiles has grown slowly until 1950 and strongly increased thereafter. Our generalized linear mixed models revealed that insularity, climatic conditions, and socio-economic development significantly influenced the distributional patterns for both groups. Main conclusionswe conclude that biological invasions by alien amphibians and reptiles are a rapidly accelerating phenomenon, particularly on islands with heterogeneous climates of economically highly developed countries."

Quantitative conservation assessments have previously considered these threats separately, yet their impacts frequently act together. We integrate forest extent maps in 2000 and 2015 with a method of quantifying exploitation pressure based upon a species' commercial value and forest accessibility. We do so for 308 forest-dependent bird species, of which 77 are commercially traded, in the southeast asian biodiversity hotspot of sundaland. We find 89% (274) of species experienced average habitat losses of 16% and estimate exploitation led to mean population declines of 37%. Assessing the combined impacts of deforestation and exploitation indicates the average losses of exploited species are much higher (54%), nearly doubling the regionally endemic species (from 27 to 51) threatened with extinction that should be iucn red listed. Combined assessment of major threats is vital to accurately quantify biodiversity loss."

Populations of resident and short-distance migrants were larger with increasing spas and aes coverage, while annex i species had higher population growth rates with increasing spas, indicating that spas may contribute to the protection of mainly target species and species spending most of their life cycle in the eu. Because farmland birds are in decline and the negative relationship of agricultural intensification with their population growth rates was evident during the implementation of aes and spas, eu policies seem to generally attenuate the declines of farmland bird populations, but not to reverse them."

Migration from rural to urban areas has forced cities to expand into the surrounding environments which created substantial environmental impacts on the functioning of natural ecosystems, affecting land use of the rural-urban interface. Understanding the human causes and consequences of land use change, particularly in urban environments, has presently become a major challenge worldwide. Strategic actions and integrated responses involving several stakeholders, including residents, policy-makers, scientists or managers will surely originate the necessary pathways and implement a more adequate planning framework to create sustainable and resilient cities. With a correct model of urban development we may preserve native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and diminish natural hazards in urban environment. We highlight the importance of greening cities and engaging residents and other stakeholders in the planning process and decision-making, as well as the importance of teaching, training or raising awareness as key actions to achieve these goals."

Saltmarshes are under threat from sea level rise, landward migration of mangroves, and in urban regions from habitat loss, input of litter, nutrients, and other contaminants. In urbanised catchments, saltmarsh areas receive nutrient-enriched and pollutant-contaminated run-off, such as heavy metals, through the stormwater system. This study aimed to investigate the impact of urban stormwater on saltmarsh and mangrove species composition and distribution. To test the effect of stormwater run-off in urbanised catchments on saltmarsh communities, we analysed the soil for pollutant elements, salinity and nutrient concentration and recorded vegetation composition at eight sites in the sydney region, australia. We found that elevated total nitrogen (> 0.4 wt%) and reduced salinity of the soil downslope of stormwater outlets facilitates establishment of exotic plants and might promote migration of mangroves into saltmarshes, resulting in a squeezing effect on the distribution of saltmarsh vegetation. Saltmarsh cover was significantly lower below stormwater outlets and exotic plant cover increased significantly with sediment calcium concentrations above 8840 mg/kg, which are associated with stormwater runoff. However, this effect was found to be strongest in highly industrialised areas compared to residential areas. Understanding the impact of pollutants on coastal wetlands will improve management strategies for the conservation of this important endangered ecological community. (C) 2018 elsevier b.v.

These birds can provide ecosystem services, such as pest control, that improve agricultural yields whilst minimising the use of agrochemicals. This study quantified avian biodiversity in rice production landscapes during three farming stages in peninsular malaysia. In malaysia, rice fields can be an important habitat for migrating birds due to malaysia's position on the east-asian-australasian flyway. We determined bird abundance, species richness, and composition in rice field landscapes and compared these during different stages of rice growing. Wetland and terrestrial birds were counted in rice fields using the point-count method. Sixty sampling points were randomly established in three locations, from which 3447 individual birds of 46 species and 26 families were recorded. There was a significant difference in total bird abundance and species richness between the three different stages of rice growing. The growing stage supported greater bird abundance and species richness compared to the pre-harvest and post-harvest stages. Rice-growing provides temporary habitats to different bird species in this managed aquatic landscape. This implies the presence of abundant food, such as small fish and amphibians. The evidence from this study suggests that biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices should be implemented to improve habitat quality for birds in rice production landscapes."

Nearshore field studies in toronto, ajax, oshawa and cobourg in 2012 and 2013, and toronto in 2015 examined the distribution of cladophora over a nutrient gradient on the north shore of the lake. Concentrations of total phosphorus, dissolved phosphorus and total inorganic nitrogen in the water column decreased from west to east over the gradient corresponding with decreasing watershed development and size. However, high surface cover and nuisance levels of cladophora biomass were found across the gradient, including the least developed study area where total phosphorus concentrations were similar to those in the open lake. The abundance of dreissena, high in all areas, was measured concurrently with cladophora biomass and correlated positively at depths of 6 to 10 m. External loading of phosphorus provides a basis for abatement of cladophora; however, the influences of enrichment along the shoreline, internal loading at the lakebed and lake trophic status in sustaining growth remain obscure. Nuisance levels of cladophora are not isolated to locations experiencing elevated external loading and should be viewed in the context of interacting area-specific and lake-wide nutrient supplies.

We show that existing marine protected areas in the arctic ocean offer little or no protection to many habitats and deep seafloor features that coincide spatially with areas likely to be of interest to industry. These habitats are globally unique, hosting arctic species within pristine environments that are currently undergoing rapid adjustment to climate-induced changes in ocean dynamics, species migration and primary production. They are invaluable as reference points for conservation monitoring and assessment. The existing arctic marine protected area network needs to be expanded in order to protect these habitats and be fully coordinated with other spatial and non-spatial measures intended to protect arctic habitats and ensure any uses of arctic marine or subsea resources are sustainable."

We compared breeding bird species composition and abundance on 10 farm pairs of each type matched at the site level for land cover in the prairie parklands of saskatchewan, canada in 1990. Land cover was measured around bird point counts at two extents; 'site' (6.3 ha area) and 'field' (16.3 ha area). We pooled species into functional groups; linear mixed models showed no significant differences between farm types for species richness but that all birds, migratory birds using crops and aerial insectivores were more abundant on organic farms. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated that farm type did not have a significant overall effect on compositional similarity but that pairwise differences existed between about half of the farm pairs (the direction of differences in beta diversity was not consistent between organic and nonorganic fauns according to tests for the homogeneity of multivariate dispersions). Farm-pair differences were more pronounced for all birds and for migratory bird species using crops, migratory birds consuming grains and ground feeders, but not grassland birds. Nmds ordinations suggested that there was more variation in species composition and abundance on organic farms than nonorganic ones but the difference was not significant. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbitda) was used to examine the main drivers of bird species composition and abundance and to see which extent was most important; land cover at the field extent was more important than land cover at the site extent or the farming practices measured. The most important field-extent land cover was the amount of native grassland, woodland (including shelterbelts) and wetlands. After controlling for significant field-extent land cover, seed treatment, herbicide use, and number of passes were significant. At the site extent, greater non-crop heterogeneity had a significantly positive effect on abundance and species richness of several groups (e.g., grassland birds, migratory granivores, ground feeders, ground nesters) but a negative effect on richness of woodland birds and abundance of aerial insectivores. Relationships with crop heterogeneity were mostly negative and non-significant. Overall land cover heterogeneity at the site level was positively related to the richness of grassland birds. In contrast at the field extent, non-crop heterogeneity did not have any significant effects on the richness and abundance of any functional group. Crop heterogeneity had a significantly negative effect on aerial insectivore richness and abundance. In the early 1990s, differences in birds between organic and nonorganic farms in saskatchewan were evident but subtle and variable among farms, and apparently most related to land cover-bird assemblage interactions/relationships."

Such negative effects may be mitigated through habitat management. To date scientific evidence regarding the impacts of these actions remains scarce. We studied guild specific abundances of breeding and staging birds in response to habitat management on 15 finnish wetlands. In this study management actions comprised several means of vegetation removal to thwart overgrowth. Management cost efficiency was assessed by examining the association between site-specific costs and bird abundances. Several bird guilds exhibited positive connections with both habitat management as well as with invested funds. Most importantly, however, red-listed species and species with special conservation concern as outlined by the eu showed positive correlations with management actions, underlining the conservation value of wetland management. The results suggest that grazing was especially efficient in restoring overgrown wetlands. As a whole this study makes it clear that wetland habitat management constitutes a feasible conservation tool. The marked association between invested funds and bird abundance may prove to be a valuable tool for decision makers when balancing costs and impact of conservation measures against one another."

To document hunting impacts on vertebrate populations regionally, we conducted an extensive literature review, including papers in local journals and reports of governmental and nongovernmental agencies. Evidence from multiple sites indicated animal populations declined precipitously across the region since approximately 1980, and many species are now extirpated from substantial portions of their former ranges. Hunting is by far the greatest immediate threat to the survival of most of the region's endangered vertebrates. Causes of recent overhunting include improved access to forests and markets, improved hunting technology, and escalating demand for wild meat, wildlife-derived medicinal products, and wild animals as pets. Although hunters often take common species, such as pigs or rats, for their own consumption, they take rarer species opportunistically and sell surplus meat and commercially valuable products. There is also widespread targeted hunting of high-value species. Consequently, as currently practiced, hunting cannot be considered sustainable anywhere in the region, and in most places enforcement of protected-area and protected-species legislation is weak. The international community's focus on cross-border trade fails to address overexploitation of wildlife because hunting and the sale of wild meat is largely a local issue and most of the harvest is consumed in villages, rural towns, and nearby cities. In addition to improved enforcement, efforts to engage hunters and manage wildlife populations through sustainable hunting practices are urgently needed. Unless there is a step change in efforts to reduce wildlife exploitation to sustainable levels, the region will likely lose most of its iconic species, and many others besides, within the next few years. Impactos de la caza sobre los bosques del sureste asiatico aunque la deforestacion y la degradacion de los bosques han sido consideradas durante largo tiempo como las amenazas mas significativas para la biodiversidad tropical, a lo largo del sureste asiatico (noreste de india, indochina, sondalandia, filipinas) hay areas sustanciales de habitat natural que tienen algunos animales silvestres (>1 kg), excluyendo a algunas especies tolerantes a la caza. Para documentar los impactos regionales de la caza sobre las poblaciones de vertebrados realizamos una revision extensiva de la literatura, incluyendo articulos de revistas locales y reportes de agencias gubernamentales y no gubernamentales. La evidencia de los multiples sitios indico que las poblaciones animales declinaron precipitosamente en la region desde aproximadamente 1980 y que muchas especies ahora estan extirpadas de porciones sustanciales de sus extensiones previas. La caza es por mucho la mayor amenaza inmediata para la supervivencia de la mayoria de los vertebrados en peligro de la region. Las causas del exceso reciente de caza incluyen el acceso mejorado a los bosques y a los mercados, tecnologia mejorada de caza, productos medicinales derivados de la vida silvestre y los animales silvestres como mascotas. Aunque los cazadores generalmente toman a especies comunes, como los cerdos y las ratas, para su propio consumo, tambien toman especies raras de manera oportuna y venden la carne excedente y los productos de valor comercial. Tambien existe una extensa caza enfocada en especies de alto valor. En consecuencia, como es practicada actualmente, la caza no puede considerarse sustentable en ningun lugar de la region y en la mayoria de las localidades la aplicacion de la legislacion de areas y especies protegidas es debil. El enfoque de la comunidad internacional sobre el mercado transfronterizo falla en abordar la sobreexplotacion de la vida silvestre porque la caza y la venta de la carne salvaje son en general un asunto local y la mayoria es consumida en las aldeas, pueblos rurales y ciudades cercanas.

Whether this input of freshwater also enriches microbial diversity as the mr plume migrates and mixes with the ngom serves as the central question addressed herein. Specifically, in this study physicochemical properties and planktonic microbial community composition and diversity was determined using itag sequencing of 16s rrna genes in 23 samples collected along a salinity (and nutrient) gradient from the mouth of the mr, in the mr plume, in the canyon, at the deepwater horizon wellhead and out to the loop current. Analysis of these datasets revealed that the mr influenced microbial diversity as far offshore as the deepwater horizon wellhead. The mr had the highest microbial diversity, which decreased with increasing salinity. Mr bacterioplankton communities were distinct compared to the ngom, particularly in the surface where actinobacteria and proteobacteria dominated, while the deeper mr was also enriched in thaumarchaeota. Statistical analyses revealed that nutrients input by the mr, along with salinity and depth, were the primary drivers in structuring the microbial communities. These results suggested that the reduced salinity, nutrient enriched mr plume could act as a seed bank for microbial diversity as it mixes with the ngom. Whether introduced microorganisms are active at higher salinities than freshwater would determine if this seed bank for microbial diversity is ecologically significant. Alternatively, microorganisms that are physiologically restricted to freshwater habitats that are entrained in the plume could be used as tracers for freshwater input to the marine environment."

This is the first ethnozoological study in pachamalai hills; the data regarding the medicinal animals/animal products were documented and their usages were analyzed quantitatively. Methods: data was collected following the interviews from key informants (n = 89) and reported diseases and health complications were classified in 18 categories. Seven quantitative indexes such as informant consensus factor (fic), fidelity level (fl), relative frequency of citation (rfc), relative importance (ri), cultural importance index (cii), index of agreement on remedies (iar) and cultural agreement index (cai) were used to analyze the reported animal species. Results: a total of 46 animal species belonging to 8 taxonomic groups were documented to be used in traditional medicine by malayalis in pachamalai hills. Animal based medicines were prepared from whole animals or their body parts or products extracted from them such as: butter, meat, milk, bones, horn, musk, skin, fin, honey, mucus, eggs, urine, excreta, hair and legs. The most encountered taxonomic group was mammalia having 14 species. Aphrodisiac ailments (aa) (0.99), dental care ailments (dca) (0.99), endocrinal disorders ailments (eda) (0.99), hair care ailments (hca) (0.99), oncology ailments (oa) (0.99) and ortho ailments (orta) (0.99) gained the highest fic value. Sus scrofa dornesticus scored the highest fl (100%) for the skeleto-muscular ailments for external cause; lissemys punctata had the highest ri value (2.00) due to its versatility and the highest frequency of citation (rfc=1.000). Gallus domesticus had the highest cultural importance (cii=8.538) and the highest cai value (cai=8.427). According to iar, plexippus paykulli (iar= 1.00), equus ferrus caballus (iar= 1.00), trachypithecus johnii (iar= 1.00), oecophylla samaragdina (iar=1.00) and apis indica (0.990) had the highest agreement among the informants for being used for the same medicinal purpose. Furthermore, no side effects have been reported from the use of abt. Conclusions: our study revealed that malayalis (pachamalai hills) possess valuable knowledge on malayalis' animal based therapies. It is believed that the present documentation will serve to record this vanishing knowledge before it is eroded completely from the island and to the scientific community. It is also anticipated that the present documentation will be fundamental to protect traditional knowledge, for the conservation and sustainable use of the rich biodiversity of pachamalai hills for future generations and to ensure pachamalai hills' sovereign rights over its genetic resources and utilization by first documenting them. In addition, further experimental investigations are required to elucidate the pharmacological properties of the reported medicinal fauna of pachmalai hills.

This is true for seahorses hippocampus comes that are obtained as part of a multi-species fishery in the philippines. Here, because seahorses are locally rare and depleted, it is difficult to attain large enough sample sizes to detect changes over time using underwater surveys. We assessed changes in seahorse sales at 2 sites, from 1996 and 2005 respectively to 2010. The study period covered local and national conservation initiatives that could affect seahorses and dependent fisheries: establishment of marine reserves (1998 onwards), a community-led minimum size limit (msl: 2002 to 2004) and a national ban on seahorse fishing (from 2004). The msl appeared to lead to increased sizes of seahorses in trade, as hoped, while the national ban led, perversely, to more fishers selling seahorses. Declines in overall take after 2004 or 2007 (depending on the site) is likely linked to declining seahorse populations rather than reduced effort, especially when one considers the increased number of fishers and the price per seahorse. It is notable that communities decided on the msl, whereas the government imposed the ban on capturing seahorses. In this small-scale, multi-species fishery, monitoring a wide range of variables intensively over a relatively long time scale allowed us to identify key differences between small-scale and industrial fisheries management, and also to document the biological and social consequences of management action for a depleted, threatened species."

Theoretically, support for conservation from rural residents who live next to protected areas is maximised if they benefit economically. Using amani nature reserve (anr) in tanzania, as a case study, this paper examines whether and to what extent eco-tourism improves local livelihoods and hence conservation. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, participatory rural appraisal and interviews with key stakeholders. Findings indicate that, over tanzanian shillings (tas) 12 million ([approximately equal] us$10,000; us$ 1=tas 1300 in november 2007) are generated by anr annually as revenue from eco-tourism. About 20% of this is distributed equally to the 18 villages that surround the reserve. Despite an increase in revenues, there was discontent among residents regarding the percentage share and other benefits they receive from eco-tourism. On average, eco-tourism contributes 9.6% of total annual household income but only 22.7% of the households earn income from eco-tourism. The paper concludes that, in anr, eco-tourism provides little benefits to local residents and suggestions for appropriate mechanisms of sharing benefits and enhancement of peoples' participation in eco-tourism are underlined."

The species and maturity stage-wise distribution of this group were studied at five discrete depths down to 1000 m. A total of 22 species belonging to four genera were observed, and the genus sagitta dominated, representing 60% (500-1000 m) to 89% (mixed layer depth) of the total chaetognath population. Based on their vertical distribution limits, four groups were recognised, as follows: i: species abundant in surface water with a maximum distribution limit up to 300 m; ii: species confined mainly to deeper waters (> 500 m); iii: species present throughout the water column (0-1000 m); and iv: species present in most layers, but with a preference for a specific depth stratum. A positive correlation (p < 0.01) was observed in the abundance of chaetognaths and their main prey copepods, emphasising the strong trophic relationship between these groups. It was found that the intensely oxygen-deficient waters of the neas play a crucial role in the vertical distribution and abundance of chaetognath species of all four genera. This report presents information on the maturity stages and ontogenetic migration of this important planktonic group in relation to the oxygen-depleted water in the study region for the first time. The results obtained are also important for understanding the biological processes associated with a major oxygen minimum zone (omz) in the global ocean. (C) 2011 elsevier ltd. All rights reserved."

These three shallow lakes share certain limnological features (size, mean depth, littoral macrophytes, among others) and the land usage in their basins (e.g. Agriculture, cattle ranching and/or touristic activities). We surveyed the bird community at these three wetlands over three years (may 2006-may 2009), using transects and point counts to characterise their species richness, abundance, community composition and seasonality. We recorded a total of 135 species belonging to 41 families. The relative importance index showed that the neotropic cormorant phalacrocorax olivaceus, the cattle egret bubulcus ibis, the white-tufted grebe rollandia rolland and the white-faced ibis plegadis chihi are the most representative species. Species richness, species composition and abundance differed between wetlands. Such differences could be attributed to particular factors such as proximity to urban centres or other wetlands, and to the impact of recreational activities. Considering that the pampean region is currently under strong anthropogenic impacts, the present study contributes to the improvement of management plans that are currently in place or under development."

They are considered to be an important driver of biological invasion and biotic homogenization on a global scale, but it remains unclear how and to what degree they serve as a pool of alien species. Data for 54 river ports (16 german, 20 czech, 7 hungarian, 3 slovak, and 8 austrian ports) on two important central european waterways (the elbe-vltava and danube waterways) were collected over 40 years. In total, 1056 plant species were found. Of these, 433 were alien, representing 41% of the total number of species found in all the studied elbe, vltava, and danube ports. During comparison of floristic data from literary sources significant differences in the percentage of alien species in ports (50%) and cities (38%) were found. The number of alien species was closely related to port size, but the proportion of alien species expressed as a percentage of the total number of species did not depend significantly on port area. The proportion of alien species in both studied waterways decreased with distance from the sea and was highest in the hungarian ports and lowest in the czech republic, austria and bavaria. Lower levels of shipping towards inland regions due to decreased river flow are likely the reason for this trend. The dissimilarity in the species composition of alien and native flora between individual river ports increased with increasing inter-port distance. Neophytes presented a stronger distance decay pattern than did either native species or archaeophytes of the danube inland ports, potentially due to the different cargoes of individual ports, which may affect the introduction of different neophytes from different geographic areas. The results show that river ports in central europe should be regarded as a type of industrial area and deserve full attention with regard to the distribution and spread of alien plants."

However, empirical evidence of such impacts is lacking. We reviewed the available literature from the last 35 years to quantify the reported effects of winter recreation on faunal communities. Overall, using one-sample binomial tests ('sign tests') we found that the effects of all types of winter recreation-related disturbances (i.e. Ski runs, resort infrastructure and winter tourism) were more likely to be negative or have no effect, than be positive for wildlife. More specifically, in europe, where the majority of the available research was conducted, the impacts of winter recreation were most often negative for fauna. In terms of specific taxa, birds and to a lesser extent mammals and arthropods, responded negatively to disturbance. Results from our meta-analysis confirmed the results from our binomial tests. Richness, abundance and diversity of fauna were lower in areas affected by winter recreation when compared with undisturbed areas. For most regions and taxa, however, empirical evidence remains too limited to identify clear impacts of winter recreation. We therefore conclude that the majority of ski resorts are operating in the absence of knowledge needed to inform effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and ecologically-sound management. Thus, there is an urgent need for more empirical research to be conducted throughout this increasingly threatened ecological community, especially given the indication from the available literature that fauna often respond negatively to winter recreation."

Critical temperature thresholds were observed at 30 and 35 degrees c, the latter representing the most thermally tolerant species in the studied area pararotalia calcariformata, which is the only symbiont-bearing species observed within the core of the heated area.

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

However, relatively little information exists about non-native marine species in china. This study provides an inventory of non-native marine and coastal species (213 species) reported to date in china (including the bohai sea, the yellow sea, the east china sea, and the south china sea). The main source regions were the atlantic, pacific, indo-pacific, and indian oceans (196 species in total, or 92.0% of species). Over one-third of non-native marine species (74 species) have established self-sustaining populations, and nearly half of the non-native species (93 species) caused negative ecological and economic impacts. The main introduction pathways of the known non-native species are ornamental trade (74 species, 34.7%), followed by aquaculture (69 species, 32.4%), shipping (65 species, 30.5%), and ecological restoration (5 species, 2.3%). The number of non-native marine species is higher in the northern sea than that in the southern sea of china. Non-native marine species have caused significant positive and negative impacts on china's environment and economy.

In the southeastern united states, these increasingly rare ecosystems are being managed using prescribed fire, but ecological responses to fire management are largely unknown, particularly among nontargeted species. We tested for short-term effects of controlled burning on the abundance and species richness of adult butterflies, which utilize coastal grasslands for nectaring resources and as migratory stopover sites. In february 2015, four plots of coastal grassland on little st. Simons island, georgia, were burned and paired with unburned (control) plots of equal size. Throughout the following summer-fall flight season, we conducted monthly point-count surveys of adult butterflies. Burn and control plots did not differ in butterfly abundance or species richness. Only one species, the gulf fritillary (agraulis vanillae), exhibited a significant response to the fire treatment; it was more likely to occur in burned areas. Overall, we found no evidence that controlled burning negatively impacts the adult butterfly assemblage utilizing coastal grassland habitat; prescribed fire may therefore be a viable management technique to conserve a range of biodiversity in these imperiled ecosystems."

We examined the influence of a natural (geology-driven acidity) vs. Human induced stress (land drainage) and their interaction on the composition and concordance of stream diatom, bryophyte and invertebrate communities. To account for differing drainage impacts in circumneutral (sedimentation) and naturally acid (reduced ph and increased metal concentrations) streams we investigated concordance in three groups of streams: reference (circumneutral and naturally acidic reference), circumneutral (reference and drained) and naturally acidic (reference and drained) streams. We expected diatoms to respond more strongly to anthropogenic acidification and more weakly to sedimentation compared to bryophytes and invertebrates. We expected overall strong concordance among the three taxonomic groups, but especially so in reference streams. All three organism groups had distinct species composition in naturally acidic vs. Circumneutral streams. Concordance between communities was overall strong, especially so in the reference streams. All groups responded to drainage disturbance in both types of streams. Invertebrates were slightly less responsive to increased acidification in the naturally acidic streams but were more affected by sedimentation in the circumneutral streams than were the other two groups. The natural stressor affected communities more than the anthropogenic stressors. Naturally stressed communities were affected by an anthropogenic stressor as much as those in more benign habitats, although the additional stressor was similar to the initial stress (further reduction of stream ph). Naturally acid streams may need special concern in bioassessment because models based on circumneutral reference sites will likely produce biased predictions for these streams. (C) 2015 elsevier ltd.

It is critical to monitor and assess the impacts of tourism on ecosystem health. However, there is a general lack of information on biological communities in natural reserves of developing countries and of tools for assessing human impacts. In the present study, we investigated macroinvertebrate assemblages in nine lakes in jiuzhaigou natural reserve of china. Both benthic (20 dips of d-net) and light-trap samples (2 h) were collected at each lake and all benthic specimens and adults of ephemeroptera, plecoptera, and trichoptera (ept) were identified and counted. Water temperature and water quality variables were measured on site or in the lab. Seventy taxa were recorded and dominated by dipterans and caddisflies. Light traps contributed 47% of taxa richness and 66% of ept richness at the lakes. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that water temperature and tourism index were strongly associated with the changes of assemblage composition. Taxa richness and eft richness calculated for the composite samples (benthic+light trap) were well fit with poisson generalized linear model (adjusted r-2 = 0.83 and 0.85, respectively), generally decreasing with increasing elevation, tourism index, and total-n. Tourism index was ranked as the top predictor for ept richness based on multiple model weights, and elevation for taxa richness. In comparison, when based on benthic samples, neither of the metrics could be fitted with the seven environmental variables selected. These findings highlight the benefit of combined use of the sampling methods for lake monitoring and offered an analytical guide to developing biological indicators of lake ecosystem health in protected areas.

However, it remains unclear how preferential selection by farmers for or against certain tree species and diameter sizes affects cc and ls trees distribution and abundance. To address this issue, we investigated how management practices may inadvertently compromise the potential of agroforestry systems to serve as reservoirs for cc and ls trees. We sampled tree diversity in 31 coffee farms and 10 forest sites in la sepultura biosphere reserve in chiapas, mexico and assessed the relative importance of shade tree density, basal area, proportion of inga spp. Trees, previous land use, and age of fallow (for farms established on land with an agricultural history) on the proportions of cc and ls trees. We then examined if tree size distributions differed between farms and forests, and whether land use legacies mediated the impact of the explanatory variables of interest. These analyses found that management practices that sought to increase the proportion of inga spp. Trees had the largest negative impact on the proportions of trees of ls and cc, but the magnitude of the effects were dependent on land-use legacy. We also found that tree size distributions differed between farms and forests among smaller trees (5-20 cm diameter at breast height, (dbh)), but not among larger trees (>30 cm dbh). These findings suggest that in order to increase the conservation potential of coffee agroforestry systems, particularly for farms established on land with an agricultural history, it is important to promote farmers' tolerance of tree species other than inga spp. And preferred tree species.

Accordingly, this study documents the abundance and diversity of anemonefishes and their host sea anemones, which are highly sought after in the trade, using timed swims at seven mid-shelf reefs on the great barrier reef, australia. Three species of anemone (entacmaea quadricolor, n = 49; heteractis magnifica, n = 7; stichodactyla mertensii, n = 3), and five species of anemonefishes were found (amphiprion akindynos, n = 12; a. Perideraion, n = 29; a. Melanopus, n = 11; premnas biaculeatus, n = 2). Many of the surveys sites (58 %) did not have anemones or anemonefishes, and at sites where they were present, numbers were generally low. Given these findings, it is essential that collection is carefully regulated to prevent localised extinctions and ensure that reproductive success is not adversely impacted."

This is particularly true for so-called ancient lakes. While these lakes are famous for being evolutionary theatres, often displaying an extraordinarily high degree of biodiversity and endemism, in many cases these biota are also experiencing extreme anthropogenic impact. Lake ohrid, a major european biodiversity hotspot situated in a trans-frontier setting on the balkans, is a prime example for a lake with a magnitude of narrow range endemic taxa that are under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Unfortunately, evidence for a ""creeping biodiversity crisis"" has accumulated over the last decades, and major socio-political changes have gone along with human-mediated environmental changes. Based on field surveys, monitoring data, published records, and expert interviews, we aimed to (1) assess threats to lake ohrids' (endemic) biodiversity, (2) summarize existing conservation activities and strategies, and (3) outline future conservation needs for lake ohrid. We compiled threats to both specific taxa (and in cases to particular species) as well as to the lake ecosystems itself. Major conservation concerns identified for lake ohrid are: (1) watershed impacts, (2) agriculture and forestry, (3) tourism and population growth, (4) non-indigenous species, (5) habitat alteration or loss, (6) unsustainable exploitation of fisheries, and (7) global climate change. Among the major (well-known) threats with high impact are nutrient input (particularly of phosphorus), habitat conversion and silt load. Other threats are potentially of high impact but less well known. Such threats include pollution with hazardous substances (from sources such as mines, former industries, agriculture) or climate change. We review and discuss institutional responsibilities, environmental monitoring and ecosystem management, existing parks and reserves, biodiversity and species measures, international conservation activities, and ongoing research on conservation and raising of public awareness. Following this summary, we evaluate the status quo and future of lake ohrid and its biota. A comprehensive conservation strategy should include measures that result in an immediate reduction of nutrient input, particularly with phosphorus, in order to slow down the ongoing eutrophication process. The existing watershed management should become more effective. Implementation and particularly with a view to the enforcement of national laws should be enhanced. Increased research on the lakes' limnology, biodiversity, and conservation management practices are necessary. The latter research should identify conservation priorities. Public awareness should be enhanced. Facing these parallel needs to protect the unique biodiversity of lake ohrid, we suggest urging (a) implementation and enforcement of the general management plan that would ensure long-term integrated and sustainable use of the lake and its watershed, (b) scientific studies on ecology, biodiversity and effects of human impact, (c) the establishment of core conservation areas (cca), including underwater reserves, and (d) coastal zone management (czm) areas that would constitute buffer zones for the ccas around the lake. Given the number of identified threats, it is clear that only concerted international action can stop or at least slow down further degradation of lake ohrid and the creeping biodiversity crisis already evident. All conservation activities should, among others, ultimately lead to a trans-boundary major conservation area of the ohrid-prespa region that would allow long-term integration of both humans and nature."

Such understanding can be approached with the drivers-pressures-state change-impacts-response framework (dpsir), incorporating stakeholders' preferences for ecosystem services to assess impacts on society. This framework was adapted to six locations in the central coast of chile, where artisanal fisheries coexist with an increasing influx of tourists, and a set of fisheries management areas alternate with open access areas and a no-take marine protected area (mpa). The ecosystem services in the study area were quantified using biomass and species richness in intertidal and subtidal areas as biological indicators. The demand for ecosystem services was elicited by interviews to the principal groups of users. Our results evidenced decreasing landings and a negative perception of fishermen on temporal trends of catches. The occurrence of recreational fishing was negligible, although the consumption of seafood by tourists was relatively high. Nevertheless, the consumption of organisms associated to the study system was low, which could be linked, amongst other factors, to decreasing catches. The comparison of biological indicators between management regimens provided variable results, but a positive effect of management areas and the mpa on some of the metrics was observed. The prioritising of ecosystem attributes by tourists was highly homogenous across the six locations, with ""scenic beauty"" consistently selected as the preferred attribute, followed by ""diversity"". The dpsir framework illustrated the complex interactions existing in these locations, with weak linkages between society's priorities, existing management objectives and the state of biological communities. Overall, this work improved our knowledge on relations between components of coastal areas in central chile, of paramount importance to advance towards an ecosystem-based management in the area.

When species value and corruption/criminality are high, the ""parallel trafficking"" hypothesis predicts that illegal animal items will move through networks used for other illicit products. Alternatively, when particular demands, logistical skills or access limits trade, ""specialized trafficking"" hypotheses predict that few, expert actors will control markets. Here, we use social network analysis of trade in an endangered songbird, the red siskin spinus cucullatus, originating in venezuela, to examine the generality of the parallel trafficking hypothesis in a setting where corruption/criminality and species value are high. In spite of these circumstances, of 2575 red siskin (rs) records compiled from 2010 to 2017, we found just six reports consistent with parallel trafficking. Instead, we discovered an independent network of 15 actor types, and a trade structure consistent with specialized trafficking. Just two intermediary types (national vendors to intermediaries and to consumers) and one consumer type (national breeders) had the highest exposure to the flow of birds, and the most trade connectivity. Use of wild-caught over captive-bred birds was high (67% of records), as was use of natural-phenotype birds over hybrid or mutant-phenotype birds (65% of records). Geographically, spain and venezuela had the highest exposure to the flow of birds, but brazil and colombia had the most direct connections with other countries. The unexpected lack of evidence for parallel trafficking suggests that combined flows of illicit products are not inevitable, even in adverse settings. In a context where law enforcement may not be feasible, our results suggest that it may be possible to reduce unsustainable harvest using breeder connectivity in informational campaigns to stimulate peer-to-peer interactions and accelerate behavior change."

We examined changes from 1911 to 2016 in the bird community of the cloud forest of san antonio, a mountain ridge in the colombian andes. We evaluated the effects of past land-use change and assessed species vulnerability to climate disruption. Forest cover decreased from 95% to 50% by 1959, and 33 forest species were extirpated. From 1959 to 1990, forest cover remained stable, and an additional 15 species were lost-a total of 29% of the forest bird community. Thereafter, forest cover increased by 26% and 17 species recolonized the area. The main cause of extirpations was the loss of connections to adjacent forests. Of the 31 (19%) extirpated birds, 25 have ranges peripheral to san antonio, mostly in the lowlands. Most still occurred regionally, but broken forest connections limited their recolonization. Other causes of extirpation were hunting, wildlife trade, and water diversion. Bird community changes included a shift from predominantly common species to rare species; forest generalists replaced forest specialists that require old growth, and functional groups, such as large-body frugivores and nectarivores, declined disproportionally. All water-dependent birds were extirpated. Of the remaining 122 forest species, 19 are vulnerable to climate disruption, 10 have declined in abundance, and 4 are threatened. Our results show unequivocal species losses and changes in community structure and abundance at the local scale. We found species were extirpated after habitat loss and fragmentation, but forest recovery stopped extirpations and helped species repopulate. Land-use changes increased species vulnerability to climate change, and we suggest reversing landscape transformation may restore biodiversity and improve resistance to future threats."

Populations of approximately 75% of the world's primates are in decline, and more than 60% of species (n = 512) are threatened with extinction. Major anthropogenic pressures on primate persistence include the widespread loss and degradation of natural habitats caused by the expansion of industrial agriculture, pastureland for cattle, logging, mining, and fossil fuel extraction. This is the result of growing global market demands for agricultural and nonagricultural commodities. Here, we profile the effects of international trade of forest-risk agricultural and nonagricultural commodities, namely soybean, oil palm, natural rubber, beef, forestry products, fossil fuels, metals, minerals, and gemstones on habitat conversion in the neotropics, africa, and south and southeast asia. Total estimated forest loss for these regions between 2001 and 2017 was ca 179 million ha. The average percent of commodity-driven permanent deforestation for the period 2001-2015 was highest in southeast asia (47%) followed by the neotropics (26%), south asia (26%), and africa (7%). Commodities exports increased significantly between 2000 and 2016 in all primate range regions leading to the widespread conversion of forested land to agricultural fields and an increase in natural resource extraction. In 2016, us $1.1 trillion of natural-resource commodities were traded by countries in primate range regions. The neotropics accounted for 41% of the total value of these exports, southeast asia for 27%, africa 21%, and south asia 11%. Major commodity exporters in 2016 were brazil, india, indonesia, malaysia an d south africa, countries of high primate diversity and endemism. Among the top 10 importers were china, the us, japan, and switzerland. Primate range countries lag far behind importer nations in food security and gross domestic product per capita, suggesting that trade and commodity-driven land-use have done little to generate wealth and well-being in primate habitat countries. Modeling of land-use and projected extinction of primate species by 2050 and 2100 under a business as usual scenario for 61 primate range countries indicate that each country is expected to see a significant increase in the number of species threatened with extinction. To mitigate this impending crisis, we advocate the ""greening"" of trade, a global shift toward a low-meat diet, reduced consumption of oil seed, diminished use of tropical timber, fossil fuels, metals, minerals, and gemstones from the tropics, accompanied by a stronger and sustained global resolve to regulate and reverse the negative impacts of growing unsustainable global demands and commodity trade on income inequality, and the destruction of primates and their habitats."

Here, we examine the relationships between conservation status and ecological traits of reef fish species of the brazilian biogeographical province. We used binomial tests and a logistic regression to address two questions. Do biological attributes differ between threatened and non-threatened fishes? Which combination of traits and impacts exerts greater influence on species threat status? Of the 559 species, 36 are categorized as threatened (compiled from global, national and local red lists). Three species are categorized as critically endangered, seven as endangered and 26 as vulnerable. Our analyses revealed that elasmobranchii, sex-changing bony fishes and endemic species are the most vulnerable reef fishes in brazilian waters. Body size and trophic category were identified as good predictors of the vulnerability of a species to extinction. Small-bodied species that are exploited by the ornamental trade and have complex reproductive strategies are also of concern. Such combinations of attributes could be of value in predicting which reef fish species elsewhere have a high risk of extinction."

Saiga antelope, black-tailed gazelle and asiatic wild ass. These species' habitat covers hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of largely ecologically intact grassland. Unless carefully planned and managed, the development of railways, highways and fences will be the catalyst for population decline and loss of important wild natural resources. 58.1 the temperate grasslands of kazakhstan and mongolia are the largest in the world and are critically important to the survival of mongolian gazelle. Asiatic wild ass and saiga antelope. 58.2 kazakhstan and mongolia are rapidly expanding their overland transportation network to support increased transcontinental trade and resource extraction. 58.3 railways, highways and fences prevent access to important seasonal resources for various species and cause the decline of wildlife populations. 58.4 future roads and railways must avoid further fragmentation. Existing roads and railways should be modified to restore wildlife movements, and fences should be modified or removed to increase connectivity. 58.5 gps tracking of long-distance migratory species that identifies preferred movement paths and existing barriers to movement is essential to properly plan infrastructure projects. Achieving a balance between healthy ecosystems and economic development is a significant and critical challenge for developing nations such as kazakhstan and mongolia. Experience from other regions has led to an established hierarchy of measures to meet this challenge - avoid, minimise, mitigate and offset. Kazakhstan and mongolia should adopt these approaches now to ensure that the imminent massive expansion of their road and railway networks has a minimal effect on biodiversity and may even result in a positive effect."

Us exports of wood pellets have grown from essentially nothing in 2008 to 4.6 million metric tons in 2015, with 99% of us pellets being shipped to europe. To examine effects of this recent expansion of the pellet industry on forest conditions, we use us department of agriculture forest service (usfs) forest inventory and analysis (fia) annual survey data for 2002-2014 to analyze changes in timberland trends since 2009 for two fuelsheds supplying pellets to the ports of chesapeake, virginia, and savannah, georgia. This analysis reveals that the chesapeake fuelshed had significant increases in acreage of large trees and harvestable carbon after 2009. Furthermore, the timberland volume within plantations increased in the chesapeake fuelshed after 2009. The savannah fuelshed had significant increases in volume, areas with large trees, and all carbon pools after 2008. Increases in carbon in live trees for the chesapeake fuelshed and all carbon pools for the savannah fuelshed for the years before and after 2009 provide empirical support to prior estimates that production of wood-based pellets in the southeast us can enhance greenhouse gas sequestration. Both fuelsheds retained more naturally regenerating stands than plantations; however the number of standing dead trees increased within naturally regenerating stands and declined within plantations (but only significantly for the savannah fuelshed). While the decrease in the number of standing dead trees per hectare for the savannah fuelshed plantations after 2009 warrants investigation into its effects on biodiversity, others have recommended thinning and hardwood mid-story control within pine plantations to provide habitat for regionally declining bird species, which is consistent with use of biomass for energy and reducing the risk of fire. While all energy use affects the environment, these results show that benefits accrue when sustainable forest management provides wood pellets for energy that keep fossil fuel in the ground. By contrast urbanization is the greatest cause of forest loss in the se us. It is essential to consistently monitor and assess forest conditions to assess changes, for exports of wood-based pellets for the southern us are expected to grow. Even though use of pellets for energy has more than doubled, the pellet industry constitutes < 1% of us forest products by weight. Therefore, any recent changes, in se us forest conditions are more likely related to the 2008 declines in the housing market. Continued analysis of annual fia data using the methods outlined in this manuscript provides a scientifically valid approach for ongoing assessment. (C) 2017 elsevier b.v. All rights reserved."

We examined the effects of disturbance and habitat fragmentation on the movements of northern pacific rattlesnakes (crotalus o. Oreganus) from 2006 through 2012 in southern british columbia, canada. We radio-tracked 44 adult male rattlesnakes through shrub-steppe, grassland, and dry forest habitats that varied from highly disturbed and fragmented to near pristine with little human interaction. Sources of disturbance were primarily associated with tourism (gol course, campground, hiking trails, roads, parking lots, vineyards, condominium complex). After accounting for interyear variation and daily temperature, rattlesnakes in undisturbed areas had larger home ranges (100% minimal convex polygon) an longer home-range lengths compared to individuals frequenting minimally to highly disturbed areas. Contrary to our predictions, snakes in highly disturbed sites did not move greater total distances, display elevated movement frequencies, higher movement rates, and/or more convoluted movement patterns."

The results show that climatic factors increase aquaculture production, whereas energy sources and growth specific factors affected the production of aquaculture in a panel of selected countries. Potential habitat area is affected by high population growth and renewable energy consumption whereas global environment facility (gef) biodiversity index is affected by average precipitation, foreign direct investment (fdi) inflows, and per capita income. Climatic factors and renewable energy both supported the total fisheries production, whereas nitrous oxide emissions, renewable internal freshwater resources, fdi inflows, per capita income, and population growth affected the production of total fisheries at different quantile distributions.

82,34,372,Aurora,not vetted,964,Littoral vegetation improves the productivity of drainable fish ponds: interactive effects of refuge for daphnia individuals and resting eggs,GABALDON CARMEN;BUSEVA ZHANNA;ILLYOVA MARTA;SEDA JAROMIR,2018,"Management of fish pond farming involves diverse practises aimed at increasing fish productivity, such as polyculture stocks, supplementary artificial feeding, adding nutrients, or drying ponds during winter or summer. Since aquatic vegetation has a positive influence on fish richness and biomass, aquatic plants could also have a positive effect on the fish productivity; however, its role has received little attention. Here, we conducted a study in which the productivity of carp was recorded in two ponds, one vegetated and the other with scarce coverage of aquatic plants. During winter, the ponds are dried, and are filled up with water in the spring. Then two-yearold carps are introduced to allow their growth until autumn when the ponds are drained and the fish harvested. The water used to fill the ponds contains no zooplankton organisms, so crustacean populations appear in the water column through the growth of hatchlings from resting stages deposited in the pond sediment during previous seasons. In order to explain patterns in fish productivity, crustaceans, which constitute an important element in the fish diet, were investigated. Particularly, the dynamics of the crustacean species were estimated during the spring and summer and, since cladoceran species are one of the main preferred preys of carp, body and clutch sizes of daphnia were measured. Moreover, the density of cladoceran resting eggs in the sediment was estimated after the dry pond was filled, and just before the next pond filling. We found differences between vegetated and non-vegetated ponds. In the pond with aquatic vegetation (1) fish productivity was higher, (2) daphnia species started to grow significantly earlier, had higher relative abundances, and delayed the population decline, (3) large sized european daphnia galeata dominated over small sized american daphnia parvula and daphnia ambigua, and (4) the cladoceran resting egg bank was less eroded during winter when the ponds were dried. The results of this study indicate that macrophytes are likely to operate as a protection mechanism, not only for individual daphnia, which keeps higher population densities and larger body sizes despite fish predation, but also protects the resting egg bank. This, in turn, was positively related to carp biomass. Accordingly, we consider that increasing macrophyte coverage should be considered in the management strategies for carp pond farming since littoral plant vegetation may act as a refuge for cladocerans as well as a productive ecotone improving the productivity of fish ponds."

Hitherto, most studies have focused on annual crops and the available information on the impacts of landscape structure in orchards is sparse. In this study, we evaluated the effects of pesticide use as cumulative toxicity on pest and predatory beetle (coleoptera) assemblages in the canopy of apple orchards surrounded by different proportion of semi-natural vegetation, crop fields and settlements in hungary. Laboratory data suggest that increasing pesticide toxicity negatively affects predators (coccinellids), but we did not find such a pattern. Supposedly, the effect of pesticides was masked by the continuous recolonisation of orchards from the surrounding landscape. On the contrary, for the less mobile pest species [anthonornus pomorum, phyllobius oblongus (curculionidae)] we did find a decline in abundance along the gradient of increasing pesticide toxicity. Landscape composition around the orchards significantly influenced the abundance of predatory, fungivorous and tourist species, but had no effect on pests. Contrary to expectations, however, semi-natural habitats had a minor effect compared to arable fields, orchards and settlements which habitat types had various effects on the abundance of different coleopteran groups and species. For example, harmonics axyridis (coccinellidae) abundance was positively affected by its overwintering sites, i.e. Human settlements in spring, semi-natural forests in summer, and arable fields in autumn. The mass immigration of other predatory, fungivorous and tourist species from the surrounding arable fields into the orchards started from july with senescence and harvesting of arable crops. These results suggest that arable fields, other orchards and settlements might be more important sources of colonisation for natural enemies in orchards than certain semi-natural habitats."

However, many studies evaluating their effects on these populations have been hindered by a lack of preconstruction data from existing natural habitats and temporal comparisons with control areas. Here, we present findings froma before-after control-impact study designed to assess the effects of a new artificial reef on fish populations in the western gulf of mexico. Vertical line and fish traps were used to sample the reef site and a paired control site with soft bottom substrates for 1 year before and 2 years after reef construction. Prior to reef construction in october 2013, and over bare substrates in general, infrequent catches of sea catfishes and small coastal sharks were observed. With the exception of rare occurrences of juvenile gray triggerfish balistes capriscus and red snapper lutjanus campechanus, which were observed only during the summer recruitment season, the control site exhibited a lack of reef species. In contrast, we documented dramatic increases in the frequency of occurrence and abundance of multiple reef species at the reef site following the addition of structured habitat. Distinct cohorts of red snapper could be followed through time suggesting site fidelity, and few fish greater than age 2 years were captured indicating limited migration of older fish from other areas. Given that the reef supported high densities of juvenile red snapper that were in good condition, growing quickly, and protected from potential shrimp trawl mortality, export of juveniles (i.e., production) to the adult population was evident and likely greater on a per-unit-area basis than for the control site. Our study highlights the potential benefits of artificial reefs to species like red snapper; however, future studies should investigate the relative roles of emigration and fishing mortality to better understand the effects of these structures on reef fish population dynamics."

We examined the relative importance of three ecological factors that have been hypothesized to influence a longitudinal pattern of fish diversity: habitat capacity, heterogeneity and immigration of diadromous fishes. Field surveys were carried out in the entire network of the shubuto river system, hokkaido, japan. A hierarchical partitioning approach revealed that distance from the sea, a proxy for immigration potential of diadromous fishes, had the greatest explanatory capacity, by which 24.9 % of variation in fish species richness was explained. Habitat capacity (approximated by catchment area) was also identified as a significant predictor of fish diversity, whereas habitat heterogeneity brought little improvement to the model performance. These results reflect the fish fauna of the shubuto river system, in which diadromous fishes are dominant in both abundance and species richness."

We hypothesised that species with greater within-population variability in migratory movements and destinations, here termed migratory diversity', might be more resilient to environmental change. To test this, we related map-based metrics of migratory diversity to recent population trends for 340 european breeding birds. Species that occupy larger non-breeding ranges relative to breeding, a characteristic we term migratory dispersion', were less likely to be declining than those with more restricted non-breeding ranges. Species with partial migration strategies (i.e. Overlapping breeding and non-breeding ranges) were also less likely to be declining than full migrants or full residents, an effect that was independent of migration distance. Recent rates of advancement in europe-wide spring arrival date were greater for partial migrants than full migrants, suggesting that migratory diversity may also help facilitate species responses to climate change."

The list comprises species known to pose great threats to biodiversity and needs to be maintained and updated. Horizon scanning is seen as critical to identify the most threatening potential ias that do not yet occur in europe to be subsequently risk assessed for future listing. Accordingly, we present a systematic consensus horizon scanning procedure to derive a ranked list of potential ias likely to arrive, establish, spread and have an impact on biodiversity in the region over the next decade. The approach is unique in the continental scale examined, the breadth of taxonomic groups and environments considered, and the methods and data sources used. International experts were brought together to address five broad thematic groups of potential ias. For each thematic group the experts first independently assembled lists of potential ias not yet established in the eu but potentially threatening biodiversity if introduced. Experts were asked to score the species within their thematic group for their separate likelihoods of i) arrival, ii) establishment, iii) spread, and iv) magnitude of the potential negative impact on biodiversity within the eu. Experts then convened for a 2-day workshop applying consensus methods to compile a ranked list of potential ias. From an initial working list of 329 species, a list of 66 species not yet established in the eu that were considered to be very high (8 species), high (40 species) or medium (18 species) risk species was derived. Here, we present these species highlighting the potential negative impacts and the most likely biogeographic regions to be affected by these potential ias."

It not only will have economic and political influences, but also may generate multiple environmental challenges and is a focus of considerable academic and public concerns [2-6]. The chinese government expects bri to be a sustainable development, paying equal attention to economic development and environmental conservation [7]. However, bri's high expenditure on infrastructure construction, by accelerating trade and transportation, is likely to promote alien species invasions [5], one of the primary anthropogenic threats to global biodiversity [8]. Bri countries may have different susceptibilities to invasive species due to different financial and response capacities [9]. Moreover, these countries overlap 27 of 35 recognized global biodiversity hotspots [10]. Identifying those areas with high-invasion risks, and species with high invasive potentials within bri countries, is therefore of vital importance for the sustainable implementation of the bri, and the development of early, economical, and effective biosecurity strategies [11]. In response, we present here a comprehensive study to evaluate invasion risks by alien vertebrates within bri. We identified a total of 14 invasion hotspots, the majority of which fall along the six proposed bri economic corridors, with the proportion of grid cells in invasion hotspots 1.6 times higher than other regions. Based on our results, we recommend the initiation of a project targeting early prevention, strict surveillance, rapid response, and effective control of alien species in bri countries to ensure that this development is sustainable."
89,41,490,Aurora,not vetted,6359,Anthropogenic disturbance can determine the magnitude of opportunistic species responses on marine urban infrastructures,AIROLDI LAURA;BULLERI FABIO,2011,"Background: coastal landscapes are being transformed as a consequence of the increasing demand for infrastructures to sustain residential, commercial and tourist activities. Thus, intertidal and shallow marine habitats are largely being replaced by a variety of artificial substrata (e. G. Breakwaters, seawalls, jetties). Understanding the ecological functioning of these artificial habitats is key to planning their design and management, in order to minimise their impacts and to improve their potential to contribute to marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Nonetheless, little effort has been made to assess the role of human disturbances in shaping the structure of assemblages on marine artificial infrastructures. We tested the hypothesis that some negative impacts associated with the expansion of opportunistic and invasive species on urban infrastructures can be related to the severe human disturbances that are typical of these environments, such as those from maintenance and renovation works. Methodology/principal findings: maintenance caused a marked decrease in the cover of dominant space occupiers, such as mussels and oysters, and a significant enhancement of opportunistic and invasive forms, such as biofilm and macroalgae. These effects were particularly pronounced on sheltered substrata compared to exposed substrata. Experimental application of the disturbance in winter reduced the magnitude of the impacts compared to application in spring or summer. We use these results to identify possible management strategies to inform the improvement of the ecological value of artificial marine infrastructures. Conclusions/significance: we demonstrate that some of the impacts of globally expanding marine urban infrastructures, such as those related to the spread of opportunistic, and invasive species could be mitigated through ecologically-driven planning and management of long-term maintenance of these structures. Impact mitigation is a possible outcome of policies that consider the ecological features of built infrastructures and the fundamental value of controlling biodiversity in marine urban systems."

Here we review the biological impacts of these construction and discuss a particular case history in the araguari river basin. Many studies showed structural changes in plant and animal populations, both in temporal and spatial scale, and works about the negative impacts of hydroelectric power plants have intensified over the years. However, the detailed consequences of the landscape fragmentation imposed by dams on plant and animal populations are still unclear. A reservoir creates a huge lakeshore, isolating areas previously connected, and transforming the environment in a mosaic of fragmented habitats. This new discontinuity can modify local biodiversity and affect important processes to fauna and flora maintenance, such as dispersal and migration ability. The new conditions imposed by a reservoir also increase soil moisture, temperature, light incidence and air speed, which alter plant communities located on the lakeshore of these dams. We carried out some such studies on forests affected by dams located on the araguari river basin and some of them showed changes in the arboreal communities and on the regeneration of seedlings, saplings and young trees after damming, suggesting modifications on structure, composition and functions of these forests."

In this study, we used a hierarchical sampling design spanning 3 orders of magnitude (1, 10 and 100 m) to investigate whether a mpa exerts an effect on amphipod assemblages associated with posidonia oceanica meadows. We report spatial and temporal variability patterns of amphipod assemblages in 4 different protection levels and discuss potential confounding effects, such as habitat features. The structure of amphipod assemblages based on density data was patchy at all spatial scales investigated, but differed markedly among protection levels. Among outstanding points, multiscale analyses showed that lower densities and/or biomasses of several taxa occurred within fully protected and external areas, in comparison with partially protected areas (ppas). Furthermore, p. Oceanica meadow features (shoot density, leaf and epiphyte biomasses, coefficient a and litter biomass) accounted for only a low proportion of the total variability. We consequently infer that the observed patchiness is likely to occur for multiple and interconnected reasons, ranging from the ecological and behavioural traits of amphipod species to protection-dependent processes (e. G. Fish predation). Long-term multiscale spatial and temporal monitoring, as well as experimental manipulations, are needed to fully understand the effects of protection on macrozoobenthic assemblages."

Coral reef declines, for example, have been linked to overfishing and climate change, but impacts of coastal development, pollution, and tourism have received increasing attention. Here, we isolated the impact of one little-studied aspect of recreational activity on coral reefs-damage from boat anchoring-by performing a survey of 24 sites in the british virgin islands (bvi) subject to varying levels of anchoring activity. The percent cover of hard corals and sea fans was reduced by a factor of similar to 1.7 and similar to 2.6 respectively at highly anchored sites. Hard coral colonies were 40% smaller in surface area and similar to 60% less dense at sites experiencing high anchoring frequency. In addition, highly anchored sites supported only similar to 60% of the species richness of little anchored sites. Frequently anchored sites were similar to 60% as structurally complex and supported less than half as many fish as those rarely anchored, with 5 of 7 fish functional groups affected. Roughly 24% of bvi coral reef by area appears suitable for anchoring, suggesting that impacts associated with boat anchoring may be both locally severe and more pervasive than previously appreciated."

Protected areas may even encourage growth by providing economic benefits that attract migrants. Consequently, understanding the relationships between human demographics and biodiversity is important for conservation. We studied a community-governed wildlife management area bordering the selous game reserve in tanzania, set up to benefit local people and the subsistence rural economy. Annual population growth in this area is 5%. We used a combination of ecological and socio-economic surveys to determine the causes of this growth and its effect on wildlife in the wildlife management area. One-third of local people interviewed were immigrants to the area. Population growth appeared to be unrelated to the protected area; instead an increasing proportion of immigrants cited readily available land as their reason for moving. Pastoralism was associated with fewer signs of large grazing mammals and elephants loxodonta africana and agriculture was associated with fewer signs of elephant and buffalo syncerus caffer but more signs of other ungulates. Few residents were aware of the wildlife management area and few received any benefits from wildlife and therefore had little reason to conserve it. This situation is attributable to poor management of the wildlife management area. Detrimental effects of human activity could spread to the selous game reserve if population growth continues. However, natural resources could benefit residents if properly managed. Interactions between human demographics and protected areas are complex and may be best managed on a case-by-case basis."

Millipedes, anurans, insects and reptiles dominated the mortalities and mammals avoided the roads. A total of 1413 individuals belonging to 56 species were killed on roads. Nocturnal species constituted 50% of these mortalities and 64% of the species composition. There was a 299% increase in road mortalities and 648% increase in nocturnal species mortality during the festival compared to those before the festival. Mean mortalities varied across habitats and were highest in moist deciduous forests. Mortalities were influenced significantly by vehicular traffic rather than rainfall. Indications of a temporary local extinction were evident beyond certain threshold of vehicular movement. The number of vehicles plying on the roads was three times higher than the threshold level as determined in this study. The festival also had a spillover effect by causing increased mortalities on roads not connected to the temple. We discuss several strategies to minimize impacts due to large scale vehicular movement inside protected areas. (C) 2011 elsevier b.v. All rights reserved."

Neotropical bat microbiota is still poorly known. We speculate that their dietary habits strongly influence their microbiota richness and antibiotic-resistance patterns, which represent growing and serious public health and environmental issue. Here we describe the aerobic microbiota richness of bats from an atlantic forest remnant in southeastern brazil, and the antibiotic-resistance patterns of bacteria of clinical importance. Oral and rectal cavities of 113 bats from carlos botelho state park were swabbed. Samples were plated on 5% sheep blood and macconkey agar and identified by the maldi-tof technique. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using kirby-bauer's antibiotic disc diffusion technique.we identified 596 isolates at the genus level and tentatively to the species level. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all the dietary guilds, representing 87% of the total identified samples. The most common bacteria within bat individuals were escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and serratia marcescens, and within bat species were serratia marcescens, pseudomonas sp. And staphylococcus sp. Frugivores presented the most diverse microbiota. In general, the antibiogram results indicated a low occurrence of resistance on eigth potentially pathogenic bacteria species. The resistance to antibiotics found on our samples was related mostly to the intrinsic resistance of the tested species.the low occurrence of resistant bacteria in our samples could be related to the well preserved environment where bats were caught. Once the major causes of resistance-acquiring are related to anthropic activites, the controlled access of tourists on certain regions of the park seems to be effectively protecting the environment."

Assessments have rarely included various taxonomic groups with different ecological and economic roles. In paddy fields with different numbers of years elapsed since the transition from conventional to organic farming, we investigated changes in the abundance of insect pests, generalist predators, and species of conservation concern. The abundance of various arthropods exhibited diverse trends with respect to years elapsed since the transition to organic farming. Larval lepidopterans, tetragnatha spiders, and some planthoppers and stink bugs showed non-linear increases over time, eventually reaching saturation, such as the abundance increasing for several years and then becoming stable after 10 years. This pattern can be explained by the effects of residual pesticides, the lag time of soil mineralization, and dispersal limitation. A damselfly (ischnura asiatica) did not show a particular trend over time, probably due to its rapid immigration from source habitats. Unexpectedly, both planthoppers and some leafhoppers exhibited gradual decreases over time. As their abundances were negatively related to the abundance of tetragnatha spiders, increased predation by natural enemies might gradually decrease these insect populations. These results suggest that the consideration of time-dependent responses of organisms is essential for the evaluation of the costs and benefits of organic farming, and such evaluations could provide a basis for guidelines regarding the length of time for organic farming to restore biodiversity or the economic subsidy needed to compensate for pest damage."

Methods: we have adopted a guild approach to investigate the impacts of island attributes on bird guild richness on a set of 41 recently isolated land-bridge islands in the thousand island lake (til), china. Results: we found insectivores had the largest number of species (34 species), followed by understory foraging guilds (28 species), omnivores (27 species) and canopy guilds (25 species). Furthermore, our data showed that migrants and residents responded equally to island area, insectivores and understory guilds were sensitive to island area but omnivores and canopy guilds were not very sensitive. Most guild richness was determined by island area, except for omnivores and canopy guilds. Conclusions: although par or habitat diversity found to be important for bird species richness, our results highlight the importance of island area in maintaining bird diversity in fragmented island systems."

Besides, the scarce multi-species studies conducted have focused on breeding data, and there is little information published on changes in wintering populations. Here, we relate the pattern of long-term temporal trends of wintering bird populations in finland, north europe, to covariates associated with climate and land-use change. Finnish wintering populations have been monitored using ca 10 km winter bird census routes (> 420 routes counted annually) during 1959-2012. Population trends of 63 species were related to migratory strategy, urbanity, and thermal niche measured as species-specific centre of gravity of the wintering distribution. Waterbird trends have shown a marked increase compared to landbirds. Among landbirds, forest species have suffered severe declines, whereas urban species have considerably increased in their wintering numbers. To follow up these results, we produced three multi-species indices (for waterbirds, forest and urban species, respectively), which can improve our ability to detect and monitor the specific consequences of climate change and changes in land-use, but at the same time act as a feedback to track the conservation status of the species. Our results suggest that waterbirds are responding to climate change, given their dependence on open water and the correlation with early-winter temperature over the last decades. On the other hand, we believe trends of landbirds have been mainly driven by human-induced land-use changes. While urban species have likely benefited from the increase of supplementary feeding, forest species have probably suffered from the loss of native habitats."

Their assemblages are influenced by environmental parameters, including the presence of alien species. Cumacean assemblages from 443 samples collected between 2005 and 2012, at 148 sites along the israeli mediterranean coast were analysed. In all, the 31,508 cumaceans were identified to 18 species. Three of the species, eocuma rosae, e. Sarsii and scherocumella gurneyi, are considered alien for the mediterranean sea. Pseudocuma longicorne, s. Gurneyi and cumopsis goodsir were the most abundant species in our samples. Cumacean densities were significantly higher in spring than in autumn, except on the shelf, where the opposite was observed. At the deeper sites (55-63 m) species composition changed between seasons, suggesting a migration of some shallow-bottom dwellers (p. Longicorne, iphinoe spp.) Into deeper waters in wintertime. Comparison among years revealed great differences in density, especially in p. Longicorne, which experienced an outbreak in 2009. Although seasonal changes may be explained by the natural dynamics of the species' life cycles, inter-annual variability is more difficult to explain. It may be related to environmental changes and especially to the infralittoral hypernutrification along the southern israeli coast, causing an increase in food availability. Cumacean alien species occurred only in haifa bay."

However, evidence of such enhancement at a regional scale has not been reported, and recently, some researchers have questioned the mangrove-reef subsidy effect. In the present study, using two different regression approaches, we pursued two questions related to mangrove-reef connectivity at the caribbean regional scale: (1) are reef fish abundances limited by mangrove forest area?; And (2) are mean reef fish abundances proportional to mangrove forest area after taking human population density and latitude into account? Specifically, we tested for caribbean-wide mangrove forest area effects on the abundances of 12 reef fishes that have been previously characterized as ""mangrove-dependent"". Analyzed were data from an ongoing, long-term (20-year) citizen-scientist fish monitoring program; coastal human population censuses; and several wetland forest information sources. Quantile regression results supported the notion that mangrove forest area limits the abundance of eight of the 12 fishes examined. Linear mixed-effects regression results, which considered potential human (fishing and habitat degradation) and latitudinal influences, suggested that average reef fish densities of at least six of the 12 focal fishes were directly proportional to mangrove forest area. Recent work questioning the mangrove-reef fish subsidy effect likely reflects a failure to: (1) focus analyses on species that use mangroves as nurseries, (2) consider more than the mean fish abundance response to mangrove forest extent; and/or (3) quantitatively account for potentially confounding human impacts, such as fishing pressure and habitat degradation. Our study is the first to demonstrate at a large regional scale (i.e., the wider caribbean) that greater mangrove forest size generally functions to increase the densities on neighboring reefs of those fishes that use these shallow, vegetated habitats as nurseries."

Yet, some decrease in the catches has been observed in recent years. We explored whether long-lasting size-selective harvesting of pikeperch together with changing climate factors might have triggered a truncation of the size-structure of the pikeperch population and resulted in the weakening of the population. Thus, we analysed long-term commercial fishery statistics (since 1931) and trawl sample data (since 1990) from the peipsi and vortsjarv lakes in terms of climate change and fishing pressure. Our study suggests that fisheries had direct negative effects on the size composition of the pikeperch population due to the nearly complete removal of the larger specimens. The truncation of the size-structure of the pikeperch population refers that cascading effect through the food web may occur as the abundance of inferior small fish has increased accordingly. Moreover, we found that climate changes influenced the pikeperch population in the same direction; large cohorts have become more frequent in the peipsi and vortsjarv lakes, and 0+ pikeperch are able to survive milder winters even without undergoing ontogenetic diet shifts. Consequently, overdensity of small fish have occurred, these effects might have serious implications for the economies of the poor rural communities that surround the lakes. The present fishing regulations seem to be inappropriate and this may lead to further population weakening and thus should be revised to provide effective protection for large. Specimens. However, continued use of active (towed) gear (e.g., danish seines) and the difficulties in enforcing fishery regulations under transboundary conditions complicate the implementation of policies that might result in more stable pikeperch populations in large estonian lakes.

However, few studies have investigated the effect of regular trampling on these fragile ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different conservation strategies (open access, partial protection, and total long-term closure) on intertidal reef tops in porto de galinhas and tamandar,, pernambuco state, brazil. Analysis of the macrobenthic community was performed with photo transects and image analysis (cpce). Twenty-seven transects were surveyed from january to august 2012, in intensively impacted (i) open-access sites, in partially protected (p) sites with occasional, illegal trampling, and in a permanently closed (c) site. In i sites, total live cover was half the cover found in adjacent p sites. The area of bare rock averaged 53.6 and 25.0 % in i and p sites, respectively. In the c site, the area of bare rock was only 19.8 %. In i and p sites, macroalgae (palisada perforata) were dominating, while in the c site, the zoanthid zoanthus sociatus was most abundant. Shell-bearing vermetids (petaloconchus varians) and bivalves (isognomon bicolor) were more abundant at the c site, being possible bioindicators for areas with zero or little trampling. Twelve years of total closure produced near-pristine communities in the c site, dominated by zoanthids and fragile mollusks. This study showed that trampling has severe and long-lasting consequences for the structure of these ecosystems."

The recent deterioration of reef health globally, including loss of coral cover, has resulted in significant declines in architectural complexity at a large, reef-scape scale. Interestingly, the fine-scale role of micro-structure in initiating and facilitating future reef development and calcium carbonate production has largely been overlooked. In this study, experimental substrates with and without micro-ridges were deployed in the lagoon at one tree island for 34 months. This study assessed how the presence or absence of micro-ridges promoted recruitment by key reef-building sclerobionts (corals and encrusters) and their subsequent development at micro (mm) and macro (cm) scales. Experimental plates were examined after 11 and 34 months to assess whether long-term successional and calcification processes on different micro-topographies led to convergent or divergent communities over time. Sclerobionts were most prevalent in micro-grooves when they were available. Interestingly, in shallow lagoon reef sites characterised by shoals of small parrotfish and low urchin abundance, flat substrates were also successfully recruited to. Mean rates of carbonate production were 374 +/- 154 (sd) g caco3 m(-2) yr(-1) within the lagoon. Substrates with micro-ridges were characterised by significantly greater rates of carbonate production than smooth substrates. The orientation of the substrate and period of immersion also significantly impacted rates of carbonate production, with caco3 on cryptic tiles increasing by 28% between 11 and 34 months. In contrast, rates on exposed tiles declined by 35% over the same time. In conclusion, even at sites characterised by small-sized parrotfish and low urchin density, micro-topography is an important settlement niche clearly favouring sclerobiont early life-history processes and subsequent carbonate production."

A critical determinant of success in achieving these goals is the financing that is committed to maintaining biodiversity(6-9); however, financing decisions are hindered by considerable uncertainty over the likely impact of any conservation investment(6-9). For greater effectiveness, we need an evidence-based model(10-12) that shows how conservation spending quantitatively reduces the rate of biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a model, and empirically quantify how conservation investment between 1996 and 2008 reduced biodiversity loss in 109 countries (signatories to the convention on biological diversity and sustainable development goals), by a median average of 29% per country. We also show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be predicted with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances the effects of conservation investment against those of economic, agricultural and population growth (human development pressures)(13-18). Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the improvement that any proposed biodiversity budget would achieve under various scenarios of human development pressure, and then compare these forecasts to any chosen policy target. We find that the impact of spending decreases as human development pressures grow, which implies that funding may need to increase over time. The model offers a flexible tool for balancing the sustainable development goals of human development and maintaining biodiversity, by predicting the dynamic changes in conservation finance that will be needed as human development proceeds."

However, original habitat at stopover sites could be affected by invasive exotic plants outcompeting native vegetation. The impact of exotic plants on the stopover behavior of migrant bird species is poorly understood. As a general hypothesis, it can be supposed that habitat change due to the presence of exotic plants will affect migrants, having a negative impact on bird abundance, on avian community assemblage, and/or on fuel deposition rate. To test these predictions, we used data obtained in august 2011 at a ringing station in a coastal wetland in northern iberia which contained both unaltered reedbeds (phragmites spp.) And areas where the reedbeds had been largely replaced by the invasive saltbush (baccharis halimifolia). Passerines associated with reedbeds during the migration period were used as model species, with a particular focus on sedge warblers (acrocephalus schoenobaenus). The saltbush promoted a noticeable change on bird assemblage, which became enriched by species typical of woodland habitats. Sedge warblers departed with a higher fuel load, showed a higher fuel deposition rate, and stayed for longer in the control zone than in the invaded zone. Invasive plants, such as saltbush, can impose radical changes on habitat, having a direct effect on the stopover strategies of migrants. The substitution of reedbeds by saltbushes in several coastal marshes in atlantic europe should be regarded as a problem with potential negative consequences for the conservation of migrant bird species associated with this habitat."

Focusing on birds and mining concessions in the northern andes, we illustrate how publicly-available data can be used in spatial prioritization tools to identify where concessions have the potential to impact 22 species of neotropical migratory birds. Concessions covered 11% of the land area of colombia, ecuador, and peru, and disproportionately occurred within important areas for migratory birds in colombia and ecuador, but not peru. Ebird data showed that one-quarter of avian species, including the olive-sided flycatcher, cerulean warbler, and canada warbler, had >10% of their global populations on concession land during the non-breeding season. More worrisome, species of greater conservation importance and with larger population declines (1974-2014) were most likely to co-occur with mining. Our approach highlights how public biodiversity data can be used to predict, avoid, or mitigate potential ecological impacts from extractive activities.

This study seeks to understand the current evolution of candomble ethnobotanical knowledge as it travels from brazil to new york city (nyc), therefore going through a second adaptation process. We identified which brazilian plant species are still in use, which are being incorporated and/or replaced, and what factors are contributing to the ethnobotanical adaptation that is taking place in nyc. To accomplish this, we compiled an inventory of liturgical plants used by five highly skilled candomble practitioners living in nyc and then compared the vernacular and binomial latin names of these plants to inventories previously published in brazil by other authors. By doing this, we were able to distinguish patterns of knowledge continuity, assimilation, or substitution. Nearly two-thirds of the species identified in nyc's inventory were cases of knowledge continuity, where most plants were used by at least four practitioners. Many of these frequently used species have survived the adaptation process from africa to brazil, and now from brazil to nyc. Practitioners also assimilated (20%) and substituted (16%) some species. The assimilation process was mainly influenced by santeria, another yoruba-derived religion widely practiced in nyc. Substitutions, however, were driven by two distinct forces. In one cohort (7%), species were morphologically and organoleptically similar to the original material, and replacements were mostly influenced by the easy accessibility of botanical materials. The other cohort (9%) was marked by a logical substitution process based on yoruba rules of plant classification. Our results show that candomble practitioners in nyc are maintaining a notable level of cultural continuity, while cautiously assimilating new species and consciously or subconsciously replacing others. Although both accessibility of plant material and cultural forces play a role in the adaptation mechanism, the latter appears to be the most relevant to these highly skilled practitioners."

We examined the influence of route 32 (a.k.a. Guapiles highway) on temporal and spatial changes in the structure of the avifauna of braulio carrillo national park, costa rica, a site crossed by this road along 25 km. The highway connects the capital city of san jose with the harbor of limon in the caribbean sea (142 km). Although the road is narrow (12 m in width and comprised by two lanes along most of the route) it services over 1.5 million motor vehicles per year, 12 % are heavy trucks and trailers. We expected the highway to divide the avifauna, and thus to observe significant differences in species structure on opposite sides of the road. We described changes in bird diversity between wet and dry seasons at las palmas and ceibo trails located on opposite sides of the highway (14 point counts per trail), and evaluated how abundance and diversity varied with road distance. Censuses took place during wet and dry seasons from 2002 to 2005. We listed 245 species and 6 035 observations during the 4-yr survey. Rare species dominated the avifauna (65 % of species < 5 observations), and species overlap between trails was high (sorensen= 71 %; morisita= 0.96). Species accumulation curves varied little among trails, yielding 190 species. Resident species represented 70 % of observations, followed by elevational (15 %) and long-distance migrants (1-2 %). Understory species were the most abundant (60 %) followed by canopy birds (30 %). Species turnover rate was 55 % between seasons, but species composition between trails remained homogeneous. Overall, birds were avoiding the road (abundance increased away from the road) although other diversity parameters (richness, dominance, shannon index, and equitability) were not influenced by road proximity. Although the avifauna remained homogeneous on both sides of the road, which did not support the fragmentation hypothesis, the highway reduced the abundance and diversity of specialized understory insectivores associated with primary forests near the road. This highway will expand outside the national park (from 2 to 4 lanes along 107 km from rio frio to limon) in the next years, which will increase traffic volume and road impacts within the park. Roads are increasing across highly diverse tropical areas justifying the need for management practices based on the identification of sensitive groups."

These ecosystems are also a magnet for tourists, who prefer these locations as leisure and holiday destinations, and such activity further increases the factors that have an adverse effect on beaches. In the study reported here the effect of human trampling on macrofauna assemblages that inhabit intertidal areas of sandy beaches was assessed using a baci design. For this purpose, three contrasting sectors of the same beach were investigated: an urban area with a high level of visitors, a protected sector with a low density of users, and a transitional area with a high level of human occupancy. The physical variables were constant over time in each sector, whereas differences were found in the intensity of human use between sectors. Density variations and changes in the taxonomic structure of the macrofauna with time were shown by permanova analysis in the urban and transitional locations whereas the protected sector remained constant throughout the study period. The amphipod bathyporeia pelagica appears sensitive to human trampling pressure and the use of this species as a bioindicator for these types of impact is recommended. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

A proportion of these species become established and cause serious environmental, economic, and human health impacts. These species are referred to as invasive, and are now recognized as one of the major drivers of biodiversity change across the globe. As a long-time centre for trade, europe has seen the introduction and subsequent establishment of at least several thousand non-native species. These range in taxonomy from viruses and bacteria to fungi, plants, and animals. Although invasive species cause major negative impacts across all regions of europe, they also offer scientists the opportunity to develop and test theory about how species enter and leave communities, how non-native and native species interact with each other, and how different types of species affect ecosystem functions. For these reasons, there has been recent growth in the field of invasion biology as scientists work to understand the process of invasion, the changes that invasive species cause to their recipient ecosystems, and the ways that the problems of invasive species can be reduced. This review covers the process and drivers of species invasions in europe, the socio-economic factors that make some regions particularly strongly invaded, and the ecological factors that make some species particularly invasive. We describe the impacts of invasive species in europe, the difficulties involved in reducing these impacts, and explain the policy options currently being considered. We outline the reasons that invasive species create unique policy challenges, and suggest some rules of thumb for designing and implementing management programs. If new management programs are not enacted in europe, it is inevitable that more invasive species will arrive, and that the total economic, environmental, and human health impacts from these species will continue to grow."

Telecoupling brings about new challenges and opportunities to biodiversity conservation that are of a larger magnitude and of a faster pace than ever observed before. Our understanding of the dynamics and leverage points of this telecoupled world is however limited. It is thus important to take stock of what we know and what we still need to know to formulate effective biodiversity conservation policies with telecoupling increasing. We identify the challenges and opportunities for biodiversity conservation brought about by the world's telecoupling in international trade and information by new technologies. Challenges are presented by the high demands for agricultural and wildlife products by high-income and emerging economies, putting pressure on land protection, management and incentive-based conservation interventions. Opportunities are brought about by the strength of telecoupled information flows that can generate strong pressure on multinationals and governments to adopt sustainable practices. Examples of these opportunities are zero-deforestation pledges and the increase in the number of certification schemes in key agricultural commodities. Conservation practitioners need to adopt a global perspective on telecoupling and focus on the new conservation opportunities represented by shaping the social norms of affluent consumers in emerging and high-income economies."

In various freshwater systems in europe, populations of native amphipods and fish are progressively displaced by highly adaptive non-indigenous species that can perform explosive range extensions. A total of 40 ponto-caspian round gobies neogobius melanostomus from the rhine river near dusseldorf, north rhine-westphalia, germany, were examined for metazoan parasites and feeding ecology. Three metazoan parasite species were found: two nematoda and one acanthocephala. The two nematoda, raphidascaris acus and paracuaria adunca, had a low prevalence of 2.5%. The acanthocephala, pomphorhynchus tereticollis, was the predominant parasite species, reaching a level of 90.0% prevalence in the larval stage, correlated with fish size. In addition, four invasive amphipod species, corophium curvispinum (435 specimens), dikerogammarus villosus (5,454), echinogammarus trichiatus (2,695) and orchestia cavimana (1,448) were trapped at the sampling site. Only d. Villosus was infected with p. Tereticollis at a prevalence of 0.04%. The invasive goby n. Melanostomus mainly preys on these non-indigenous amphipods, and may have replaced native amphipods in the transmission of p. Tereticollis into the vertebrate paratenic host. This study gives insight into a potential parasite-host system that consists mainly of invasive species, such as the ponto-caspian fish and amphipods in the rhine. We discuss prospective distribution and migration pathways of non-indigenous vertebrate (round goby) and invertebrates (amphipods) under special consideration of parasite dispersal."

However, investigations that quantify temporal changes in biodiversity in response to multiple forms of disturbance in space and time are relatively uncommon. Over a 10-yr period, we investigated the response of bird species to spatiotemporal changes in forest cover associated with logging and wildfire in the mountain ash (eucalyptus regnans) forests of southeastern australia. Specifically, we examined how bird occurrence changed with shifts in the proportion of area burned or logged in a 4.5 km radius surrounding our 88 long-term field survey sites, each measuring 1 ha in size. Overall species richness was greatest in older forest patches, but declined as the amount of fire around each site increased. At the individual species level, 31 of the 37 bird species we modeled exhibited a negative response to the amount of fire in the surrounding landscape, while one species responded positively to fire. Only nine species exhibited signs of recovery in the 6 yr of surveys following the fire. Five species were more likely to be detected as the proportion of logged forest surrounding a site increased, suggesting a possible ""concentration effect"" with displaced birds moving into unlogged areas following harvesting of adjacent areas. We also identified relationships between the coefficients of life history attributes and spatiotemporal changes in forest cover and stand age. Large-bodied birds and migratory species were associated with landscapes subject to large amounts of fire in 2009. There were associations between old growth stands and small-bodied bird species and species that were not insectivores. Our study shows that birds in mountain ash forests are strongly associated with old growth stands and exhibit complex, time-dependent, and species-specific responses to landscape disturbance. Despite logging and fire both being high-severity perturbations, no bird species exhibited similar responses to fire and logging in the landscape surrounding our sites. Thus, species responses to one kind of landscape-scale disturbance are not readily predictable based on an understanding of the responses to another kind of (albeit superficially similar) disturbance."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between landbird community composition and land cover in and surrounding urban park reserves in the mississippi river twin cities important bird area (iba) in order to evaluate this area's value during both spring migration and summer breeding seasons. This iba includes a mosaic of residential, commercial, and park reserve land running along the mississippi river between minneapolis and hastings, minnesota. Using citizen-science data collected at 8 park reserve sites in the iba between 2007 and 2010, we calculated species richness, diversity, and evenness for the migrating and breeding landbird community at each site and categorized species into three conservation statuses (species of greatest conservation need, native and exotic) and four migratory behavior classes (permanent residents, short-distance migrants, resident neotropical migrants, and en-route neotropical migrants). We used aic to rank multiple regression models to evaluate how these groupings vary across sites in comparison to the land cover in and surrounding each site. We found that most measures of both the spring migration and breeding communities were negatively related to increased impervious cover. Exotic species and permanent residents were less affected by surrounding land use, while breeding season resident and transitory neotropical migrants were greatly affected. Patterns of landbird richness and density suggest that removing impervious cover within lower quality sites can improve habitat supporting migrating birds."

The vicissitudinous behavior of economy, the whimsical oscillations of diet composition, human migrations, technological advances in plant breeding and even the biological peculiarities of the crops can have the effect of fostering the increase or decline of species diversity in agriculture at several geographic scales, as well as of changing the genetic diversity of crop species. Some of these factors, such as mechanization and selection methods, are intrinsic to the various agricultural models adopted, while others, including migration from the countryside to the cities and the fortuitous introduction of devastating pests, are historically contingent. In this chapter, we use a few indexes to quantify the changes in crop species diversity and crop intraspecific diversity that took place in brazil in the last decades, at several spatial scales, with emphasis on the southeastern region, and investigate the main phenomena that have caused them."

In this study, we examine the pattern of invasion of trypanosoma cruzi-the causative agent of human chagas disease-in the city of arequipa, peru. Phylogenetic analyses of 136 t. Cruzi isolates from arequipa and other south american locations suggest that only one t. Cruzi lineage established a population in arequipa as all t.

Among 6,000 species of coccinellids described worldwide, only 75 species have been reported from pakistan so far. Keeping in view the limited work on these important beetles, an extensive faunal survey was conducted in the district sargodha (32 degrees 05'02"" n and 72 degrees 40'18"" e), pakistan to assess the species richness and distribution of coccinellid beetles in seven selected regions (bhera, bhalwal, kot momin, sahiwal, sargodha, shahpur and silanwali). A total of 1,470 coccinellid specimens were collected from all types of vegetation and were identified up to species level by means of external morphology, published descriptions and male genitalia micrometry. Nine species were identified belonging to 9 genera and 4 subfamilies occurring along with 10 trophic associations.

Here, reef fish are one of the main touristic attractions, but there are no published surveys focused on fish community in this site. In this study we analyzed the spatio-temporal variation of the fish community in different areas of the marine park xel-ha. Abundance and richness were estimated during one-year period (2012-2013); visual censuses using fixed transects of 100x5 m each distributed in 21 transects along five sites were established in different zones: ""bocana"", ""center"", ""north branch"", ""cave"" and ""river"", including the inlet mouth to the sea, brackish mangrove channels and a zone with freshwater influence. To characterize the fish community, we used species richness, abundance, diversity, and density compared among zones and climatic seasons (rain, ""norths"" and dry). The similarity among zones and seasons was estimated using a multidimensional scaling analysis. The replacement on the species composition among seasons and sites was realized based on the presence-absence of fish. The influence of physicochemical variables such as temperature, salinity and dissolve oxygen concentration in the fish community was estimated by a principal component analysis. A total of 22 641 individuals were recorded corresponding to sixty-three species over the year. Abundance was higher during the windy season (locally named ""norths"") with 7 991 organisms. The most representative species according with abundance and frequency of occurrence were: haemulon sciurus, h. Flavo-lineatum, lutjanus griseus, acanthurus coeruleus, abudefduf saxatilis, and gerres cinereus. Diversity increased from the rainy to the dry season; species richness and diversity was lower in ""river"" than other sites in xel-ha. Most species (54 %) species were residents through the year. Four non-shared species were observed during the rainy season and three in dry season. Dissolved oxygen was the most influential variable on the fish community composition among zones. Xel-ha houses nearly 20 % of fish biodiversity reported for the mexican caribbean, and the predominance of juveniles of several species confirms its role as a nursery area."

To prevent the spread of tpis under climate change, we must identify the risk hotspots for tpis. However, the risk hotspots for tpis have not yet been explicitly addressed at the global scale under climate change. Here, we selected 336 tpis from the invasive species specialist group list and used species distribution modelling and hot spot analysis to map the risk hotspots of tpis based on the terrestrial ecoregions in the current, low and high gas concentration scenarios. The risk hotspots of tpis were mainly distributed in south america, europe, australia, new zealand and northern and southern africa. Climate change may decrease the areas of hotspots that allow for tpi expansion, but the potential distribution probabilities of tpis may increase in the high concentration scenario. Furthermore, tpis, particularly herbaceous and woody ones, might still expand into critical or endangered ecoregions of these risk hotspots in the current, low and high concentration scenarios. We also need to focus on the impact of tpi expansion on both vulnerable and relatively stable ecoregions due to the increasing potential distribution probabilities of tpis in risk hotspots and should integrate climate change into the risk assessment of plant invasion in the vulnerable and relatively stable ecoregions."

In finland, atlantic salmon and both seamigrating and lake-migrating brown trout are stocked as eggs, alevins, fry, parr, and smolt, whereas trout are also stocked as mature fish. The aim of this stocking is to improve catches and to support collapsed spawning stocks. We assessed the success of stocking with brown trout eggs in a study of 17 finnish boreal forest rivers, of which 9 were subject to egg stocking. All rivers contained some naturally spawning trout. In 16 rivers, including non-stocking years and unstocked rivers, egg stocking did not increase the total (wild and stocked) density of 0-year-old parr. However, those rivers with higher existing trout densities in non-stocking years seemed to benefit most from stocking, suggesting some role of river-specific extrinsic factors affecting egg-to-parr survival. In one river monitored for 14 years, only a weak correlation was found between the total density of 0-year-old parr and the number of eggs stocked. However, in nine parr samples from five rivers, the mean proportion of parr derived from stocked eggs was 40%. The mean survival to first autumn parr of egg-stocked and wild individuals was 1.0 and 3.3%, respectively. Probable reasons for the detected low to moderate impact of egg-stocking are (i) large variation in total parr density between years and rivers, (ii) small number of stocked eggs, (iii) placing egg boxes and egg pockets in unsuitable microhabitats, and (iv) unsuitable emergence time of egg-stocked individuals, or other extrinsic factors creating extra mortality. We recommend field and laboratory experiments to improve and standardize stocking methods, and monitoring the connection of wild spawning stocks and parr recruitment. Finally, we encourage fishery authorities to create clear management goals for threatened wild salmonid stocks."

In this study, the biofilm microflora of historic limestone tombstones located in a highly polluted urban environment (cambridge, ma) and in a less polluted location (lexington, ma) were compared using comprehensive rna-based molecular analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences as well as sequences of genes for different pathways of sulphur metabolism (soxb, apsa, dsra). The metabolically active micro-organisms detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16s rrna fragments were predominantly represented by cyanobacteria (belonging to the family nostocaceae and to the genus chroococcidiopsis) in both polluted and unpolluted environments. The investigation of soxb, apsa, dsra transcripts reflected the abundance and the diversity of sulphur-oxidizing and sulphate-reducing bacteria in the cambridge samples in comparison with the lexington samples. The investigation revealed that in addition to phototrophic sulphur bacteria belonging to the genera thiocapsa, halochromatium, allochromatium, thiococcus and thermochromatium, other sulphate-oxidizing prokaryotes (e.g. The genus thiobacillus) as well as sequences of deltaproteobacteria from the genus desulfovibrio occurred at the polluted urban site. The interactions between the main functional groups retrieved from the limestone tombstones were discussed. Significance and impact of the studythe biofilm microflora inhabiting historic limestones are a multi-component open ecosystem sensitively reacting to all environmental factors including air pollutants. Little is known about specific target groups that are active in the biofilm and their physiological functions.

Satellite images and aerial photography were used to characterize coastal types (e.g. Substrate, geomorphology and wave energy to describe beaches, mangroves, or rocky shores), and then field assessments ranked four types of anthropogenic impacts that influence ecosystem function and coastal system services. The ranking of coastal health was based on physical alterations, destructive use of the coastal zone, coastal development and occurrence of invasive alien species (ias). The characterization and assessment methods were developed to serve as a rapid survey of coastal stability, biological diversity and quality of wildlife habitats. A system of coastal ranking is presented using numerical scores for four impact criteria along with terrestrial plant surveys to examine the intactness of the coastal environment. Some locations (exuma and great guana cay) were repeatedly monitored over time. Scores ranged from ""0"" for no human impacts or invasive coastal plants to ""20"" for highly altered with dredging, coastal development and loss of native vegetation. The mean impact rank for all sites across all islands was 5.7 +/- 4.3, which indicates ""medium"" ranks for at least two of the four human impact criteria. Only one uninhabited island (cay sal) had all coastal impacts scores of ""none"". Over 77% of all the sites surveyed had abundant occurrences of invasive alien species (ias) coastal plants. The australian pine (casuarina equisetifolia) was the more pervasive and the most widespread ias in the coastal environment, and its abundance increased in all sites that were re-surveyed over time. Degradation of coastal function can signal greater risks to coastal property, flooding events or loss of wildlife populations. The coastal impact ranking protocol presented here helps identify target areas for conservation as well as identify areas with the greatest feasibility for coastal restoration. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

We also attempted to quantify changes in intact egg and ephippia density through repeated vehicle travel over a track on virgin playa. We found no observed decrease in intact egg or ephippia density attributed to incrementally increased vehicle travel over virgin playa, which may be attributed to strength of the playa substrate matrix. Differences in intact egg and ephippia density were substantially lower in heavily used vehicle tracks than in adjacent playa, but differences were not statistically significant. Density of intact eggs and ephippia in black rock city were lower following the festival, but differences were statistically significant only for eggs in camping areas and not roads. Weak effects observed on these roads may be attributed to dust abatement that maintained substrate density."

Using a dictator game, we ask for donations from individuals in denmark, spain, and ghana for the protection of natural habitats of the migratory montagu's harrier (circus pygargus). We focus on citizens from denmark, spain and ghana since these countries lie along the harrier's migratory route. We found that information affects donation behavior, albeit differently in each country. Our danish and ghanaian participants contributed more when (1) pre-donation information stressed that transnational collaboration is needed, and (2) they were told that a measure of their group's donation would be forwarded to other participants. In contrast, our spanish participants donated less overall and were insensitive to the information treatments. The results document large differences across countries in supporting behavior in such transnational conservation settings and could influence how international conservation organizations organize and shape fundraising for their work."

In order to know more about the species present in this tributary, we aimed to provide an inventory of fish fauna of the congonhas river and reproductive strategies to determine whether the river is used by migratory species and whether there is a longitudinal variation in the fish assembly. These findings will provide subsidies to contribute to the implementation of policies to protect biodiversity. Samplings occurred in the upper, middle and lower stretches of the congonhas river during four periods between 1991 and 2011. Fishes were captured using gill nets from 2 to 14 cm mesh sizes between opposite knots and cast nets, identified and categorized according to their reproductive strategies. A total of 4,640 individuals belonging to 63 species, of which 79.4% consisted of characiformes and siluriformes were captured. Furthermore, 14% of fish were long-distance migratory species (e.g., piaractus mesopotamicus, megaleporinus obtusidens, prochilodus lineatus, salminus brasiliensis, pinirampus pirinampu, and pseudoplatystoma corruscans). In addition, there was an increase in the fish species richness from upstream to downstream. Management actions such as prohibition of fishing, rehabilitation of riparian vegetation, and protection of the basin against dam construction will reduce anthropogenic impacts on the ecosystem.

The aim of this research is to evaluate whether these patterns from laboratory experiments are consistent across host species and occur in the field at broad spatial scales. Location time period contiguous u.s.a. 1998-2009. Major taxa studied methods amphibian hosts and bd. Our data included 3,946 individuals evaluated for bd infection across 49 amphibian species, which resulted in 155 estimates of bd prevalence in populations. We used multimodel inference to examine associations between bd infection prevalence in amphibian populations and (a) total pesticide use, (b) pesticide use by type (herbicide, insecticide or fungicide), and (c) the most commonly used pesticide compounds across life stages, controlling for several factors documented to affect the distribution of bd. Results main conclusions consistent with laboratory findings, our results indicate that use of multiple herbicide compounds is most closely associated with low infection risk in the aquatic larval stage but high risk in the terrestrial post-metamorphic stage when controlling for insecticide and fungicide use. We caution against assuming that insecticides and fungicides do not influence bd distributions, because use of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides are all correlated positively. The effects that pesticides can have on disease distributions are complex and should be considered strongly at broad scales and across host species, especially in environments in which use and exposure are widespread. Accurate predictions of disease distributions may lead to more effective management strategies to limit disease spread."

We use a combination of line-transect surveys in 2002 and 2009 (n = 540 km) and ethnographic interviews (n = 210) to investigate changes in the status of cerco-pithecines and colobines at rds, with additional comparisons to earlier work. This protected area was lightly logged in the 1970s and the park was gazetted in 1990, with multiple-use reserve sectors allocated. Since the park's inception, hunting and the trade of primates have increased, along with human migration, greater accessibility of arms, and reduction of preferred ungulate prey. Primates have declined in both the park and reserve sectors. Our data further suggest that at rds hunting has had a greater impact on primate diversity and abundance than logging. We have identified changes in species-specific vulnerability to hunting over time, with cercopithecus nictitans and lophocebus albigena initially having appeared to be relatively resistant to hunting pressure in 2002. However, subsequently as gun hunting has increased at rds, these species have become vulnerable. Although monkeys at rds have been responding behaviorally to increased gun hunting, they are not able to keep pace with changing hunting practices. This study allows us to begin to understand synergistic impacts of hunting and logging, necessary if we are to recommend strategies to better secure the future of primates in multiuse protected areas.

I island. Because this shrimp, halocaridina rubra ('opae'ula), displays a preference for autotrophic components of epilithon, we hypothesized that tree canopy would reduce their body condition and abundance, but that this would be moderated by nutrient quality of leaf litter (high-quality, non-native, nitrogen-fixing tree vs. Low-quality, endemic non-nitrogen-fixing tree). We hypothesized that poeciliid invasion would reduce population size and body condition of h. Rubra by direct predation and by inducing reductions in feeding rate. Analysis of stable isotopes (delta d, delta c-13, and delta n-15) showed that direct consumption of leaf litter detritus supplemented h. Rubra diet in ponds with canopy cover. In addition, epilithon in ponds with canopy cover was isotopically more similar to leaf litter than epilithon in ponds without canopy cover, and our evidence suggests this may be due to contributions of allochthonous nutrient sources to epilithon assemblages. However, canopy cover, whether native or invasive, did not decrease epilithon growth rates and had little effect on shrimp body condition or population size. In contrast, poeciliid invasion reduced daylight grazing on the benthos, and caused a reduction in body condition among larger shrimp. Our results indicate that primary succession by invasive trees may shift food web linkages in these ponds from autotrophic to heterotrophic support, without negative impacts on native grazer/detritivore communities. We suggest that poeciliid invasions have sub-lethal effects on h. Rubra as well as their direct predation effects, with potential long-term implications for the ecosystem function of anchialine ponds and other coastal systems."

The history of its invasion has been poorly investigated in central and eastern europe, and the current variations in densities of mink populations are not well studied, thus making a reduction of its impact difficult. Here we analyse the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of the american mink population in poland, which began to establish itself at the beginning of the 1980s and originated from polish farm escapees and immigrants from lithuania and belarus. Mink dispersal started in the north and continued to the south and in 2016 mink occurrence was recorded across ca. 75% of the country. By about 1997 mink had colonised half of poland, and in 2016 the only mink-free area was in the south and south-east of the country. The rate of expansion showed accelerating and decelerating patterns, and reached its maximum 12years after the beginning of the expansion. Mink farming in western poland developed rapidly after 2000 and probably influenced acceleration of mink range expansion rates in years 2006-2008. Indices of mink densities showed significant nonlinear change over time since local populations were established and were highest in populations estimated to be 10-15years old. The prediction of non-native species invasion rates and population dynamics should be incorporated into management actions curbing their negative impact on native fauna."

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

These interactions are often driven by continent-scale weather patterns and are difficult to study. Few studies have included migratory animals on more than a single trophic level or for periods spanning multiple entire seasons. We tracked migrations of three species of agricultural pest noctuid moths over the 2010-2012 autumn seasons as the moths travelled past a large colony of migratory brazilian free-tailed bats (tadarida brasiliensis) in texas. Increases in moth abundance, mass of bats and duration of bat activity outside of the cave were correlated with passage of cold fronts over the study area and related increases in northerly wind. Moth responses to weather patterns varied among species and seasons, but overall moth abundances were low in late summer and spiked after one or more cold front passages in september and october. Changes in bat mass and behaviour appear to be consequences of bat migration, as cave use transitioned from summer maternity roost to autumn migratory stopover sites. Weather-driven migration is at considerable risk from climate change, and bat and moth responses to that change may have marked impacts on agricultural systems and bat ecosystem services."

To explore this assertion, we sampled the bird communities in fifteen randomly selected sites in pafos forest, cyprus and used multiple regression to quantify the effects of such roads on the total species richness. Moreover, we classified birds according to their migratory status and their global population trends, and tested each category separately. Besides the total length of unpaved roads, we also tested: a. The site's habitat diversity, b. The coefficient of variation in habitat (patch) size, c. The distance to the nearest agricultural field, and d. The human population size of the nearest village. We measured our variables at six different distances from the bird point-count locations. We found a strong negative relationship between the total bird richness and the total length of unpaved roads. The human population size of the nearest village also had a negative effect. Habitat diversity was positively related to species richness. When the categories were tested, we found that the passage migrants were influenced more by the road network while resident breeders were influenced by habitat diversity. Species with increasing and stable populations were only marginally affected by the variables tested, but the effect of road networks on species with decreasing populations was large. We conclude that unpaved and sporadically used roads can have detrimental effects on the bird communities, especially on vulnerable species. We propose that actions are taken to limit the extent of road networks within protected areas, especially in sites designated for their rich avifauna, such as pafos forest, where several of the affected species are species of european and global importance.

The status of freshwater biota in the vicinity of existing dams could be valuable to predict the effects of such developments, but detailed ecological monitoring before and after dam construction is frequently lacking. 2.In the absence of these data, we used a space-for-time replacement to compare a key component of the aquatic biota at upstream and downstream sites, with the latter more closely resembling river channel conditions prior to the dam. We assessed the fish assemblages upstream and downstream of the coaracy nunes dam in amapa, brazil, the first ecological study at this site since this dam was constructed 42years earlier. We used gillnets during eight bimonthly field campaigns, covering both wet and dry seasons, and sampled the ichthyofauna (1819 individuals, 81 species) at four sites: downstream channel, reservoir, upstream lake and upstream channel. 3.We found clear negative impacts on the abundance, biomass, species richness, alpha diversity and species dominance upstream of the dam. The physical subdivision of the river channel and the upstream channel conversion from lentic to lotic habitats were strongly associated with differences in the composition and structure of fish communities. Notable changes include an increased contribution of small-bodied fish in the reservoir and an absence of long-distance migrants upstream of the dam. 4.Downstream channel habitats, in particular, retained their fish diversity with high conservation value typical of eastern amazonia, yet these areas now face the threat of new hydropower development farther downstream. The long-term impacts on aquatic biodiversity highlighted in this study are especially relevant in the face of burgeoning new hydroelectricity development plans for rivers across lowland amazonia."

Alburnus, and 2 other sites were located below the dam where cul. Alburnus was present, having migrated upstream from the feitsui reservoir. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predation impacts of cul. Alburnus by comparing the compositions, abundances, and size-frequency distributions of fish communities above and below the check dam. In total, 2791 individuals of 18 fish species were collected, including 275 cul. Alburnus caught below the dam. A diet analysis showed that 11 of 30 cul. Alburnus (33.3%) had consumed a total of 26 fish, 23 of which were candidia barbata. The abundance of can. Barbata was significantly greater above the dam. Additionally, the body size of can. Barbata collected above the dam averaged < 12.9 cm, whereas the body size of individuals below the dam averaged > 11 cm. We concluded that predation by the introduced cul. Alburnus resulted in a decrease in the total abundance and a change in the age structure of populations of native fish species, such as can. Barbata, that occupy mid- and surface waters. It is possible that predation by the introduced cul. Alburnus may also generate a trophic cascade effect on the animal communities in lotic waters. To conserve the freshwater biodiversity in taiwan, we suggest that greater attention be given to the introduction of indigenous fish species by administrative agencies and the general public to prevent invasions by exotic species."

INTENSE CONCENTRATION OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND MASS TOURISM ARE LEADING TO COASTAL DUNE LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION. BESIDES THE LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION OF COASTAL DUNES, MASS TOURISM HAS CONSIDERABLY AFFECTED REMNANT NATURAL AREAS. TO PREVENT DEGRADATION OF REMNANT NATURAL AREAS, IT IS MANDATORY TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS, TOURISM CAN BE ALLOWED. IN THE PRESENT STUDY I ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM BY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF TOURISM ON THE STRUCTURE AND RESILIENCE OF POLLINATION NETWORKS IN COASTAL DUNE ECOSYSTEMS FREELY ACCESSIBLE TO TOURISTS. POLLINATION NETWORKS REPRESENT ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND DEPICT INTERACTIONS AMONG SPECIES, PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A HOLISTIC ASSESSMENT OF ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING. I CONDUCTED THE STUDY ON COASTAL DUNE SITES OF THE NORTH ADRIATIC COAST, WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TOURISTIC PRESSURE. I RECORDED POLLINATION INTERACTIONS TOGETHER WITH DESCRIPTORS OF HUMAN DISTURBANCE ALONG SEA-INLAND TRANSECTS. A MODERATE LEVEL OF HUMAN DISTURBANCE WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE RICHNESS OF ANIMAL-POLLINATED PLANT AND POLLINATOR SPECIES. BESIDES SPECIES RICHNESS, THE RESILIENCE OF POLLINATION NETWORKS WAS ALSO HIGHEST AT MODERATE DISTURBANCE. BY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF HUMAN DISTURBANCE ON COASTAL DUNE ECOSYSTEMS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF POLLINATION INTERACTIONS, EVIDENCE ARISES THAT MODERATE DISTURBANCE AND LONG-TERM CONSERVATION OF POLLINATION NETWORKS OF COASTAL DUNES CAN CO-EXIST. HOWEVER, TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, TOURISM SHOULD BE REGULATED, AND VISITOR ACCESS TO COASTAL SITES MANAGED, SO AS TO PREVENT INTENSE HUMAN DISTURBANCE FROM COMPROMISING BOTH THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF COASTAL DUNE ECOSYSTEMS."

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF EXCRETION, EGGS, MILT, AND CARCASSES AS NUTRIENT AND ENERGY SOURCES FROM A LARGE POPULATION (82449 SUCKERS) OF MIGRATING LONGNOSE (CATOSTOMUS CATOSTOMUS) AND COMMON WHITE (CATOSTOMUS COMMERSONII) SUCKERS INTO A SMALL (WETTED WIDTH C. 10M) OLIGOTROPHIC RIVER SYSTEM. WE HYPOTHESISE THAT THE ADFLUVIAL SUCKERS PROVIDE A LARGE MATERIAL SUBSIDY THAT INCREASED THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE CYPRESS RIVER AND THAT THIS RESOURCE SUBSIDY RIVALS OR EXCEEDS THOSE DELIVERED BY OTHER NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE FISHES (E.G. PACIFIC SALMONIDS). IN TOTAL THERE WAS AN ESTIMATED 5635KG OF EGGS, 2025KG OF MILT, AND 1KG OF CARCASSES FROM SUCKERS THAT SPAWN IN THE CYPRESS RIVER. RELATIVE TO OTHER MAINLY NON-NATIVE FISHES, SUCKERS PROVIDED 92% OF THE ANNUAL EGG BIOMASS AND 95% OF THE MILT.

Cultivars In North America?,PETERSON B J;STACK L B;HAYES D J,2018,"Some eurasian shrubs, including species of lonicera, have become invasive in north america. Recently, lonicera caerulea cultivars have been developed from eurasian germplasm and promoted for north american markets as honeyberry, haskap, or sweetberry honeysuckle. Checklist-based evaluation tools offer insight into the invasive potential of non-native plants introduced to north america, but can be difficult to utilize effectively for taxa with limited cultivation histories. The recent arrival of l. Caerulea to north america's horticulture trade makes it difficult to answer questions that rely on an established history of ecological interactions in an introduced range. The only ecological observation that we have found in north america is a 2011 report of a naturalized woodland population of reproductive honeyberry shrubs in minnesota. However, in northern europe, the norwegian biodiversity information centre reported that eurasian l. Caerulea has spread rapidly from planted localities, and poses risks of severe impacts to norway's natural plant communities. Our best interpretation of available data used in two risk-assessment tools developed for north america indicates that cultivars of eurasian l. Caerulea pose a high risk of invasiveness. A complicating factor is the native occurrence of the closely related mountain fly honeysuckle [lonicera caerulea subsp. Villosa (michx.) A. Love & d. Love] and blue fly honeysuckle [lonicera caerulea subsp. Cauriana (fernald) b. Boivin] in portions of north america where cultivars of eurasian l. Caerulea have been promoted. Fly honeysuckles tend to be sporadic, small in stature, and not particularly productive; conversely, eurasian cultivars have been hybridized and selected for rapid growth and high yield. Unanswered concerns include: (1) should l. Caerulea germplasm from eurasia be considered native in north america; (2) could hybrid, eurasian genotypes of l. Caerulea exhibit greater competitive fitness than the north american fly honeysuckles; and (3) will the introduction of eurasian l. Caerulea cultivars have population genetic consequences for indigenous fly honeysuckles?"

As a consequence, trade affects ecosystems, but trade is not currently a major topic in ecosystem research based on a survey of ecological journals. This survey reveals trade is rarely a title word or topic except for studies considering the movement of species or sustainability. However, when trade is considered at large scales, ecosystem mass balances are significantly influenced by traded products such as the nitrogen and phosphorus in fertilizers and livestock feeds. Trade also depletes resource species leading to ecosystem alterations such as the elimination of large predators and filter feeders in aquatic ecosystems and landscape conversion with attendant changes in biogeochemistry and biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. Trade is a source of alien species introductions. Trade also creates telecouplings among distant locations that cause changes in ecosystems including changes that may affect whether an ecosystem is a source or sink in relation to atmospheric carbon dioxide. There is a need for improved data tracing traded products, understanding the linkages of trade between ecosystem sources and sinks, and developing new methods and models to analyze trade impacts. Studies of trade impacts in relation to questions about changing ecological processes and the trajectory of ecosystems represent an important frontier."

All major invasions are due to the actions of humans such as deliberate introductions or escapes, and hitchhiking with global trade of species to other continents. Though majority of introductions have only minor impacts to the ecosystem, some of them led to numerous problems. 48 exotic species have been recorded from saudi arabia; of which 9 are recorded for the first time from saudi arabia. Among these, the species that potentially damaging the biodiversity or altering the ecosystems in general are: argemone ochrolecuca, nicotiana glauca, opuntia dellenii, opuntia ficus-indica, prosopis juliflora and trianthema portuiacastrum. Among these, p. Juliflora has been observed in lower altitudes with a density of more than 6%/hectare followed by o. Dellenii and n. Glauca in areas above 1000 m. Mountains and wadis have the highest values in terms of species richness, cover and exotic species impact. Analysis showed that environmental and diversity variables have high significant variation between habitats. Invasive and other exotic species are correlated positively with altitude and most diversity indices except with species dominance which are correlated negatively. (C) 2015 elsevier ltd.

Management agencies then face the difficult task of providing recreation and tourism opportunities without compromising environmental values. This study assessed the success of efforts aimed at conserving alpine vegetation along the mt bogong massif in victoria, australia, through controlling the use of horses. Vegetation condition was assessed in 2001 to coinciding with restrictions on the use of horse riding on trails and then resurveyed 10years later. Sampling was undertaken in track plots that included the trail and surrounding vegetation, and control plots located away from the trail. There were significant differences in the amount of bare ground, the height of shrubs and ground layer vegetation, and shrub cover between track and control plots in 2001. Ten years later, track plots were recovering with reductions in bare ground and changes in vegetation, with improved ground layer vegetation height. Results show that vegetation condition has improved with restrictions of horse numbers. The indicators selected were sensitive to changes in vegetation condition and hence should be used for ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of this and similar management interventions."

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of trampling intensity (low, high use trails and untrampled trails) and distance from the trails (on the trails, at 10 and 20 m from the trails) on the vegetation, chemical, physical and microbiological properties of a soil in mediterranean mountain areas. Trail type and distance from the trail significantly influenced several parameters. High use trails showed lower values of plant cover and diversity of vegetation species, as well as soil respiration and some enzyme activities (phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and dehydrogenase) than low use trails. In addition, the effects of trampling spatially extended further from these high use trails than from low use trails. Statistical analysis showed that some microbiological (basal respiration, dehydrogenase activity and beta-glucosidase activity) and vegetal parameters (plant cover and diversity) may be established as a set of indicators for the evaluation of soil quality on these areas subjected to human trampling. We concluded that trampling significantly impacts on soil microbial processes and vegetal communities, and visitor should be restricted from entering ecologically sensitive areas due to the effects of trampling.

We examined competing models, which linked the prevalence of bse in five focal countries, volume of beef exports to those countries from north america, and the amount of hayfield harvested and the abundance of grassland birds in north america. We found that (i) imports from north america increased 1 y after bse outbreaks; (ii) probably because fewer cattle remained, the hay harvest in north america was reduced 2 y after the outbreak; (iii) the reduced hay harvest yielded a positive response in grassland bird populations 3 y after the outbreak."

A growing human population, and a 40-fold increase global trade and transportation may provide the most significant challenge to park service management: the invasion of alien plants, animals, and diseases into so called 'protected areas'. General ecological theory suggests that an increase in biological diversity should increase the overall stability of an ecosystem. We provide examples of plant invasions in u.s. National parks to show that, despite increases in plant diversity, alien plant species are capable of greatly affecting the native species that the parks were established to protect. Furthermore, alien plant species are affecting natural patterns of grazing, disturbance, and nutrient cycling, resulting in decreased habitat quality, perhaps providing less resistance and resilience to natural and anthropogenic stresses such as climate change, land use change, recreation, and future invasions. The primary mission of the national park service, protecting native species and ecosystems for present and future generations, may be increasingly difficult due to the continuing invasions of alien organisms. Key elements of an effective invasive plant management programme are identified."

This study presents results of surveillance studies performed at the lillgrund wind farm in sweden to investigate the integrated effects of these factors on the abundance and distribution patterns of benthic fish communities. The studies revealed no large-scale effects on fish diversity and abundance after establishment of the wind farm when compared to the development in 2 reference areas. Changes in some species and in community composition were observed over time but occurred in parallel in at least one reference area, indicating that fish communities in the wind farm area were mainly driven by the same environmental factors as those in surrounding areas. However, changes at smaller spatial scales were evident. Increased densities of all studied piscivores (cod, eel, shorthorn sculpin), as well as the reef-associated goldsinny wrasse, were observed close to the foundations in the first years of operation. The increase was probably attributed mainly to local changes in distribution rather than to immigration or increased local productivity. Simultaneously, weak or no aggregation of black goby, eelpout and shore crab, all potentially reef-associated but also prey species of the studied piscivores, was observed, which may indicate enhanced top-down control near the foundations."

In europe, populations of five alien squirrel species are reported. The pet trade represents a high-risk pathway for the introduction of rodents, which are likely to become invasive because of their reproductive biology and wide native distribution ranges. In the european union, a trade ban has been imposed on some particularly impacting species, such as the eastern grey squirrel sciurus carolinensis. Eradication and numerical control is needed for most introduced squirrels in europe (including the siberian chipmunk), according to european union regulation 1143/2014 on alien species. We summarise the current distribution of the ground-dwelling siberian chipmunk eutamias sibiricus, one of the most common pet squirrels in europe and asia, in its invasive range. Established populations of siberian chipmunk, in most cases composed of small numbers of individuals, currently occur in france, switzerland, italy, germany, belgium, the netherlands, denmark, and russia. The species was present in austria, sweden, and hong kong, and unsuccessful introductions occurred in spain and the british isles. The first records from greece are also reported. Most introductions took place during the 1990s, when individuals were intentionally released (67% of extant populations result from such releases). Population size was correlated with the proximity to urban areas. Human risk of infection with the agent of lyme borreliosis seems to be the highest where populations of alien siberian chipmunk occur. Other impacts have never been reported. Competition with native rodents (e.g. The red squirrel sciurus vulgaris and dormice, gliridae) has been speculated on, as well as predation on nests of native warblers (sylvidae). Impacts by alien siberian chipmunks have been overlooked for a long time. Despite this, given that the species may affect native biodiversity and human health, eradication of established populations is recommended."

Fishing pressure is predominantly driven by both market access and local population density, and has a clear negative effect on the diversity and function of coral reef fishes. The strong positive effect of market access on fishing pressure makes clear the importance of understanding social-ecological linkages in the context of increasingly connected societies. This study highlights the need to address broad social phenomena rather than focusing on proximate threats such as fishing pressure, to ensure the continued flow of coral reef goods and services in this time of rapid global social and environmental change.

Studies dedicated to assessing the extent and underlying dynamics of wire-snare poaching in south africa are lacking, and no formal research has been conducted in the boland region, despite growing evidence of wire-snare incidence. Through structured interviews with farm owners, managers and labourers on private agricultural properties bordering protected areas (pas), this study quantified the influence of several socioeconomic and biophysical determinants on the incidence of wire-snare poaching across the study area. Wire-snare poaching incidence and behaviour was strongly influenced by economic factors relating to poverty, a perceived lack of governing regulations and punitive measures, interpersonal development, and abiotic factors such as proximity to major residential areas, roadways and pas. Respondents reported that small antelope and porcupine were most affected by wire-snare poaching. Several activity hotspots across the region were identified. This study provided the first demonstration of the multifaceted and complex nature of wire-snare poaching in the boland region. In doing so, a dialogue was opened between rural communities and conservation agencies to broaden our understanding of the heterogeneity in local-scale socioecological dynamics, to apply policies for effective management and eradication, and to provide grounds for future research in the area and elsewhere."

Meanwhile, artificial wetlands, such as aquaculture ponds, saltpans and rice paddies, have increased in area. Artificial wetlands typically host fewer species and fewer individuals of waterbirds compared to natural ones, thus the conservation importance of artificial wetlands in general appears secondary. However, over large areas of densely populated east and southeast asia, few coastal lands above the high tide line remain natural. Waterbirds may utilize the natural intertidal zone at low tide, but are forced to feed or roost in artificial environments when tidal flats are submerged. In such landscapes, coastal artificial wetlands are not only supplementary or alternative to natural ones, but provide crucial habitats for waterbirds at high tide. To investigate the use of artificial wetlands by waterbirds in such a landscape, we studied supratidal waterbird communities in changhua, taiwan, an important stop over and wintering site on the east asian-australasian flyway. We found very high species richness and abundance of waterbirds in the area compared to other studies conducted in artificial wetlands. This might have been partly due to the fact that we censused waterbirds at high tide, when artificial wetlands were the only habitat available. Waterbird abundance and species richness were higher at sites with intensive clam aquaculture and less fragmentation, reflecting the preference of shorebirds. Despite the fact that past transformation of natural coastal wetlands into artificial ones has had negative impacts on waterbirds, these artificial wetlands nowadays may provide exclusive supratidal habitats for waterbirds in many regions. Suitable artificial supratidal habitats for waterbirds need to be managed along with natural tidal flats as part of the same system."

A previous study revealed that during a recent period of local warming the species extended its distribution into namibian waters, where it hybridised with the resident and congeneric argyrosomus inodorus. Environmental changes are a major threat to marine biodiversity and when combined with overfishing have the potential to accelerate the decline of species. However, little is known regarding the evolutionary history and population structure of a. Coronus across the abfz. We investigated genetic diversity, population structure and historical demographic changes using mtdna control region sequences and genotypes at six nuclear microsatellite loci, from 180 individuals. A single, genetically homogeneous population was indicated across the distributional range of a. Coronus (phi(st) = 0.041, f-st = 0.000, d = 0.000; p > 0.05). These findings imply that the oceanographic features within the abfz do not appear to significantly influence population connectivity in a. Coronus, which simplifies management of the species. However, reconstruction of the demographic history points to a close link between the evolutionary history of a. Coronus and the environmental characteristics of the abfz. This outcome suggests the species' vulnerability to the rapid environmental changes being observed across this region, and highlights a pressing need for transboundary management to mitigate the impacts of climate change in this global hotspot of seawater temperature changes."

African penguin spheniscus demersus numbers at the robben island colony rose during the 1990s co-incidental with a marked increase in sardine sardinops sagax and anchovy engraulis encrasicolus abundances, but decreased appreciably during the 2000s as sardine suffered a series of poor recruitments. A population dynamics model is developed which relates penguin adult annual mortality to local sardine biomass, and is fit to penguin moult counts and re-sightings of tagged penguins. The predator-prey interaction is best explained by a sardine-penguin mortality relationship with average penguin survival decreasing only when the local sardine biomass is less than approximately one-quarter of the maximum observed. Results suggest that the rapid growth of the colony during the 1990s was driven primarily by immigration. Penguin projections are generated by linking to future sardine abundances predicted under the operational management procedure used to set catch limits for these sardine and anchovy fisheries, and compared with equivalent scenarios without fishing. Results indicate that fishing is likely to have a relatively small impact on penguins, especially when compared with uncertainties that arise from the variable spatial distribution of the sardine population."

Predator-control aims to reduce an impact on prey species, but efficacy of long-term control is rarely assessed and the reductions achieved are rarely quantified. Aims. We evaluated the changing efficacy of a 58-year-long campaign against red foxes (vulpes vulpes) on phillip island, a 100-km(2) inhabited island connected to the australian mainland via a bridge. The campaign aimed to eliminate the impact of foxes on ground-nesting birds, particularly little penguins (eudyptula minor). Methods. We monitored the success rate of each fox-control technique employed, the level of effort invested if available, demographics of killed foxes, the numbers of penguins killed by foxes and penguin population size. Key results. The campaign began as a bounty system that ran for 30 years and was ineffective. It transitioned into a coordinated, although localised, control program from 1980 to 2005 that invested considerable effort, but relied on subjective assessments of success. Early during the control period, baiting was abandoned for less effective methods that were thought to pose fewer risks, were more enjoyable and produced carcasses, a tangible result. Control was aided by a high level of public awareness, by restricted fox immigration, and by a clear, achievable and measurable target, namely, to prevent little penguin predation by foxes. Carcasses did prove valuable for research, revealing the genetic structure and shifts in fox demographics. The failure of the program was evident after scientific evaluation of fox population size and ongoing fox impacts. In 2006, the campaign evolved into an eradication attempt, adopting regular island-wide baiting, and since then, has achieved effective knock-down of foxes and negligible predation on penguins. Conclusions. Effective predator control was achieved only after employing a dedicated team and implementing broad-scale baiting. Abandoning widespread baiting potentially delayed effective control for 25 years. Furthermore, both predator and prey populations should be monitored concurrently because the relationship between predator abundance and impact on prey species is not necessarily density dependent. Implications. Critical to adopting the best management strategy is evaluating the efficacy of different methods independently of personal and public biases and having personnel dedicated solely to the task."

Among its aquatic fauna molluscs, crustaceans and fishes represent the most prominent groups of invaders in terms of species number and biomass. The listed reptile species is in the list of the 100 worst invasive species in the world. This paper reviews available information about the arrival time, way of introduction, distribution area, dominance in communities, ecosystem functions, and impact on the native fauna along the hungarian stretch of the danube of 43 non-indigenous species having arrived from several continents as africa, asia, europe, north america, or new zealand. Transport vectors that contribute to the introduction and the rapid spread of alien species are river shipping, deliberate crayfish and fish stocking, pet trade, release from aquaria, and food consumption. The invasions of the studied species have a potential to alter the structure and the function of danubian ecosystems and create new biodiversity and economic problems. Due to the international importance of the river danube, efforts should be made to prevent new invasions and manage the existing invaders along the whole river."

These meadows follow a growth cycle closely tied to the seasonal hydrological fluctuation: as water levels recede in the fall, exposed mudflats provide habitat for carex spp. Growth. The seasonal growth of carex overlaps the arrival of wintering geese and provides an important food source for the migrants. Recent alterations to the yangtze's hydrology, however, have disrupted the synchronous relationship between water levels, carex growth and wintering geese at dongting lake. In october 2012, we carried out an outdoor mesocosm experiment to investigate potential impacts of delayed water recession on the germination and growth of carex heterolepis, the dominant carex species at dongting lake, to understand how changes in hydrology might impact wintering goose habitat. Results showed that the delayed flood recession exerted significant impact on the first growth cycle of carex growth. Prolonged inundation significantly lowered the intrinsic growth rate (p = 0.03) and maximum growth rates (p = 0.02). It also took significantly longer time to reach the peak growth rate (p = 0.04 and 0.05 for number of shoot and biomass, respectively). As a result, biomass accumulation was reduced by 45, 62 and 90 % for 10-day, 20-day and 30-day inundation treatments, respectively. These results indicate a severe risk of food shortage for wintering geese when water recession delayed. This potential risk should be taken into consideration when operating any hydrological control structures that alter the flood regimes in dongting lake."

We then analyze how biodiversity and forest cover differ between a pa, and communities with different market access. Finally, we link biodiversity and forest cover changes within communities to differences in land-use practices. While we show similar levels of forest cover and biodiversity between the pa and large cprs with little access to local markets, institutions appear not to attenuate market effects on conservation outcomes in our case studies. We discuss results within a common-property theory context and highlight the importance of disentangling how market integration, common-pool resource institutions, and resource health interact over time."

Although it is well known that provision of winter food resources can attract farmland birds, there is continuing uncertainty over the ability of aes to provide tangible benefits for target species in terms of increased abundance. Answering these questions is hampered by interannual fluctuations in bird populations and the mobility and territoriality of farmland birds, which have complicated the interpretation of previous studies. We monitored birds for five years on a large arable estate in central england managed under varying levels of aes uptake (low level uptake of simple and widely applicable aes options, more extensive uptake of more complex aes options), and two control treatments (on-site and off-site). Bird abundance in winter and both total abundance and number of territories in the breeding season were calculated from monthly visits to 16 transects. Several species showed significantly higher winter abundance on aes treatments, particularly granivorous species (e.g. Reed bunting, yellowhammer, linnet). Many other species (e.g. Blackbird, chaffinch, robin) also showed significant differences in winter abundance between treatments on the estate and off-site controls. In the breeding season, linnet, reed bunting, goldfinch and combined granivorous birds showed higher abundance or number of territories on aes treatments compared to on-site controls. For most other species the differences were only significant between treatments on the estate and off-site controls. Independently of aes treatment, a lower coverage of cereals or greater shannon diversity of crops in the local landscape also had a positive effect on the abundance of many species. Our results suggest that well-implemented aes can significantly enhance local populations of both farmland specialists of conservation concern and generalist species. Our results also show that, in many cases, these effects were only demonstrable at the farm scale, in comparison with off-site controls. This is probably due to high levels of movement and dispersal of birds resulting in a farm-scale spill-over of beneficial effects of agri-environment measures. Our results therefore highlight the importance of thinking beyond the single-farm scale when designing schemes or studies for monitoring the effectiveness of aes, and the importance of selecting appropriately located controls."

However, the loss of habitat in the high andean region is extensive. In particular, montane forests are being subjected to strong anthropogenic pressures: so protected areas are important conservation tools. Unfortunately, habitat degradation and loss also affect these areas. Cajas national park is a protected area within this region that contains montane forest influenced by different levels of anthropic alteration. We sought to understand how the community of non-flying small mammals responds to habitat changes in montane forest areas. To this end, we evaluated the differences in the composition of the community of non-flying small mammals on eight plots in two localities with differing anthropogenic pressures: mazan, an area closed to tourists with greater plant diversity and trees with greater diameters, and llaviucu, an area open to tourists with lower diversity and lower average tree size. In total, 877 individuals of 13 species were recorded. Nephelomys albigularis, akodon mollis and thomasomys baeops were the most abundant. Ordination of the community revealed a tendency to separate the composition between the two study sites; phyllotis andium, thomasomys caudivarius and caenolestes fuliginosus tend to cluster in plots characterized by an increase in the number of trees with larger diameters and greater plant diversity. This feature explains how species associated with more arboreal habits, sensitive to habitat change, are more strongly associated with mature montane forests strictly protected from human impacts."

We identified 547 local culturally important species (lcis): 369 were threatened by traditional practices (e.g., hunting) and 161 were protected (e.g., totemic species). Most lcis were found in the indomalayan, neotropical, and afrotropical regions and roughly 30% were involved in nature-based tourism, particularly mammals. Very few lcis (<5) were threatened by tourism.

Through the crack, 6 hm(3) of acidic water and metallic mud were spilt, defaunating a large area of the guadiamar river. After the spill cleanup and habitat restoration, multiple anthropogenic impacts continued to degrade the affected area. This work aimed to provide the most updated list of fish species in the guadiamar river basin after the spill. Data were collected between 1999 and 2011 by electrofishing, light-traps, minnow-traps and multimesh gill-nests in 78 sampling sites. Species richness values for both native and exotic species in the guadiamar river basin were high when compared with values for other right bank tributaries of the guadalquivir river. This may be due to direct contact with the mouth of the guadalquivir, which allowed the presence of migratory species. It may also be due to its location in the lower part of the guadalquivir river basin, where exotic species accumulated. Among the guadiamar river basin species, luciobarbus sclateri and squalius alburnoides have the widest distribution. The former is a generalist species resistant to unfavourable habitat changes, and the latter has a very successful breeding strategy. However, when focused on the affected area, there was a marked increase in exotic species, and both pumpkinseed (lepomis gibbosus) and carp (cyprinus carpio) co-dominated together with the native l. Sclateri and s. Alburnoides. The distribution of species within the river basin suggests that the upper section (except the agrio reservoir) and middle section tributaries may be acting as native species shelters, while the affected area becomes an exotic species source. This information should be useful for monitoring future changes in the species composition and for management planning measures."

We investigated an impoundment with permanent connection and homogeneous environmental conditions between the zones above and below the dam. Temperature was comparatively higher during wet season irrespective of zone, and both zones had higher dissolved oxygen, conductivity and transparency in the dry season. A total of 1687 individuals comprising 27 species were collected in the downriver zone, while the reservoir had 879 individuals and 23 species. Each zone had different fish assemblage composition and structure, but assemblages were not explained by the examined environmental variables (r(2) - 0.08; p - 0.307). Migratory species such as pimelodus maculatus, pimelodus fur, leporinus copelandii and prochilodus lineatus were the most affected, and probably are prevented to perform upriver migrations. On the other hand, lentic adapted species such as g. Brasiliensis, hoplias malabaricus and hoplosternum littorale successfully colonised the reservoir. Therefore we conclude that the presence of the lateral hydrological connectivity alone does not guarantee the ecological connectivity since fish assemblage similarity differed between the two zones. Fish passage facilities should be monitored and managed to evaluate and improve their functionality."

However, empirical evidence of such impacts is lacking. We reviewed the available literature from the last 35 years to quantify the reported effects of winter recreation on faunal communities. Overall, using one-sample binomial tests ('sign tests') we found that the effects of all types of winter recreation-related disturbances (i.e. Ski runs, resort infrastructure and winter tourism) were more likely to be negative or have no effect, than be positive for wildlife. More specifically, in europe, where the majority of the available research was conducted, the impacts of winter recreation were most often negative for fauna. In terms of specific taxa, birds and to a lesser extent mammals and arthropods, responded negatively to disturbance. Results from our meta-analysis confirmed the results from our binomial tests. Richness, abundance and diversity of fauna were lower in areas affected by winter recreation when compared with undisturbed areas. For most regions and taxa, however, empirical evidence remains too limited to identify clear impacts of winter recreation. We therefore conclude that the majority of ski resorts are operating in the absence of knowledge needed to inform effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and ecologically-sound management. Thus, there is an urgent need for more empirical research to be conducted throughout this increasingly threatened ecological community, especially given the indication from the available literature that fauna often respond negatively to winter recreation."

Northern tourist destinations are nowadays like towns with high numbers of people during the peak seasons and the urban structure of the nearby landscape. In this study, our aim was to investigate the effects of tourist destinations on nest predation risk, potential nest predator abundance, and the assemblages of birds across an urban gradient from uninhabited forests via tourist destinations to towns in northern finland. The impact of the relatively small-scale seasonal tourist destinations (ski resorts in our case) in areas close to the wilderness end of the urban-rural-wildland gradient has not received attention before. Our data include all the main ski resorts located in northern finland and their surrounding forest areas as well as the biggest towns located within the study area. We evaluated nest predation risk by means of an artificial ground nest predation experiment. The abundance of potential nest predators as well as bird community assemblages were evaluated using the point count method. Our results showed that artificial ground nests preyed upon and the abundance of corvids increased with increasing urbanization, and the proportional abundance of ground-nesting species decreased with increasing urbanization. Nest losses, the abundance of corvids, and the proportional abundance of ground-nesting species were intermediate in the tourist destinations when compared to the towns and forests. Our results indicated that seasonal ski resorts may have negative impacts on bird assemblages, and more attention should be paid to area planning in tourist destinations and their surroundings. These results have significant implications for improving land use planning of northern ski resorts and conserving birds at seasonal tourist towns."

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

Studies to assess the potential impacts of the dwh oil spill on dolphins in the northern gulf of mexico were initiated as part of a natural resource damage assessment and included photographic-identification (photo id) surveys to determine abundance, density, and site fidelity in st. Joseph bay, florida (sjb). Although significant oiling did not occur in sjb, long-term data have been collected in this region to provide insight into population-level trends in abundance/density over time. Thus, sjb dolphins could serve as a reference for comparison to other dolphin populations exposed to dwh oiling. During 2005-2007, the results of photo id and telemetry surveys determined seasonal fluctuations in abundance and identified two different dolphin populations in sjb: residents sighted across multiple seasons and years (st. Joseph bay stock), and visitors that were present during the spring and fall and associated with a 2-3 fold increase in abundance (northern coastal stock). The goals for the current study were to compare dolphin abundance, density, and site fidelity, prior to (2005-2007), during (2010), and post-dwh (2011 and 2013) using photo-id surveys and a spatially explicit robust-design capture-recapture (serdcr) model. The data collected during and post-dwh paralleled previous research in that a low number of individuals with high site fidelity were sighted across seasons and years (st. Joseph bay stock), and abundance/density increased in the fall as a result of an influx of dolphins that were likely members of the northern coastal stock. However, june and august 2010 abundance (347; 193-498, 95% ci and 394; 288-534, 95% ci, respectively), density (dolphins/km(2)) (2.60; 1.36-3.70, 95% ci and 2.55; 1.89-3.29, 95% ci, respectively), and site fidelity patterns were more similar to previous years' spring and fall data, with high abundance estimates, increased dolphin density in coastal waters, and elevated numbers of individuals with low site fidelity in the sjb region. Factors that could have contributed to this increase in abundance include immigration of dolphins from adjacent estuaries, population growth within the st. Joseph bay stock, impacts from dwh oiling, and environmental and/or prey-based cues that influence movements of the northern coastal stock. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of long-term monitoring to assess impacts of current and future stressors on the dolphins in the northern gulf of mexico."

This study was focused on diavs located in the highlands (800-2800 m) around the equator (1 degrees n-5 degrees s). The following questions were addressed: (i) what differences exist between endemic and non-endemic species in terms of species number, frequency and abundance? (Ii) are patterns of alpha- and beta-diversity correlated with latitude? (Iii) what are the major environmental drivers controlling spatial patterns in species composition and occurrence? Methods we established 63 transects of 5 x 100 m in areas with diav vegetation, impacted as little as possible by human activities. In each transect, all mature trees and shrubs were identified and counted to determine their density. The coverage of terrestrial herbs was estimated. Generalized additive models were used to quantify the relationship between alpha- and beta-diversity with latitude. To record beta-diversity, we used the exponential shannon index. The sorensen index was used to measure beta-diversity or species turnover. We used canonical correspondence analysis to determine species composition and generalized linear mixed models to quantify simultaneously the determinants of species occurrence across species and sites. The models were evaluated using the akaike information criterion. All analyses were run separately for trees, herbs and shrubs. Important findings overall, we found that shrubs was the most diverse life form, constituting 43% (12% endemic) of the 313 species, followed by herbs (36%; 11.5% endemic) and trees (20%; 5% endemic). Trees comprise mostly species with low abundance (e.g. <3 individuals ha(-1)), which was also true for herbs, whereas shrubs showed a larger number of abundant species (>30 individuals ha(-1)), including four endemic species. Most of the endemic species were locally rare, and most of them were restricted to southern valleys, suggesting low migration rates due to local barriers. We identified seven species distribution patterns that gave rise to high beta-diversity in the dry inter-andean valleys. The beta-diversity of trees was the lowest. Herbs had the highest beta-diversity, which increased steadily with geographic distance. Our results further highlight the influence of disturbance, water availability and low temperature on plant species composition and occurrence. We also found significant, contrasting patterns in responses to environmental drivers, when analyzing our data separately by life form. Our results show that analyzing diversity patterns separately by life form can shed new light on the mechanisms that have generated present-day patterns of plant diversity in diavs."

We suggest that the multibillion dollar cashmere industry creates economic motivations that link western fashion preferences for cashmere to land use in central asia. This penchant for stylish clothing, in turn, encourages herders to increase livestock production which affects persistence of over 6 endangered large mammals in these remote, arid ecosystems. We hypothesized that global trade in cashmere has strong negative effects on native large mammals of deserts and grassland where cashmere-producing goats are raised. We used time series data, ecological snapshots of the biomass of native and domestic ungulates, and ecologically and behaviorally based fieldwork to test our hypothesis. In mongolia increases in domestic goat production were associated with a 3-fold increase in local profits for herders coexisting with endangered saiga(saiga tatarica).That increasing domestic grazing pressure carries fitness consequences was inferred on the basis of an approximately 4-fold difference in juvenile recruitment among blue sheep(pseudois nayaur)in trans-himalayan india. Across 7 study areas in mongolia, india, and china's tibetan plateau, native ungulate biomass is now<5% that of domestic species. Such trends suggest ecosystem degradation and decreased capacity for the persistence of native species, including at least 8 asian endemic species: saiga, chiru(pantholops hodgsoni), bactrian camel(camelus bactrianus), snow leopard(panthera uncia), khulan(equus hemionus), kiang(e. Kiang), takhi(e. Przewalski), and wild yak(bos mutus). Our results suggest striking yet indirect and unintended actions that link trophic-level effects to markets induced by the trade for cashmere."

This study aimed to construct a species checklist for the sharks and rays occurring in the solomon islands, review the human interactions with these species, and present a synthesis of their conservation status. Given the paucity of available data, a wide range of data sources were used including fisheries data, citizen science, and ethnobiological studies.

Fifty sharks and rays were identified from the solomon islands, of which 20 are assessed as vulnerable or endangered on the iucn red list, 10 in the convention on international trade in endangered species, and 11 in the convention for migratory species. The checklist also presents an eastwards range extension for the endangered dwarf sawfish pristis clavata. Fishing appears to be the main impact, though impacts from habitat loss and degradation are possible. This study provides a systematic synthesis and review of the biological diversity, uses, and cultural significance of solomon islands sharks and rays, and describes a process for assembling species checklists and reviews in data-poor contexts. However, this synthesis is based on limited information and a complete assessment of shark and ray status in the solomon islands will require primary fieldwork."

Once introduced into its new environment, feral populations may arise and pose threats to local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In france, it is in fact considered as a risk for the mediterranean pond turtle, mauremys leprosa, and the european pond turtle, emys orbicularis, as they may compete for resources and habitat. Freshwater turtles are also host to a variety of parasites including protozoans and helminths. When introduced turtles escape, parasites may spread to native species. The objective of this study was to document the extent of platyhelminth invasions from t. S. Elegans to natural m. Leprosa populations in northern spain and southern france and to evaluate the risks that parasite host-switching may pose on indigenous freshwater turtle species. From dna barcoding analysis based on the sequencing of the cytochrome c oxidase i gene, the bayesian tree and p-distance comparisons of closely related haplotypes revealed a greater polystome richness within m. Leprosa than expected, suggesting that host switching may take place in natural environments. Because these parasites most typically infest american turtles like chrysemys picta marginata and graptemys pseudogeographica in their natural home range and because parasites were also found within t. S. Elegans feral populations, it is suggested that the red-eared slider would serve as a carrier for a variety of not strictly host-specific polystomes that are transmitted to m. Leprosa throughout the south of france. The global trade in freshwater turtles thus provides opportunity for parasites to be transported to new destinations which could impact the physiology, behavior and survival of native turtle species."

This has resulted in substantial decrease in biodiversity, including the hippopotamus (hippo) population. There are currently about 150,000 hippos left in the world. Their status will change from vulnerable to endangered if threats are not controlled. The threats include destructive exploration and exploitation for human survival through hunting for ivory and meat, habitat loss due to flooding and destruction of hippo lawns along river banks. Sustainable exploration of biodiversity on the other hand ensures a balance in nature through synergistic cooperation in ecosystem services, human well-being as well as the direct and indirect drivers of change. This study assessed the emerging transition from survival to sustainability in the management of community-based biodiversity management in ghana. Ghana has two hippo populations; one at bui national park and the other at the wechiau community hippo sanctuary (wchs). The wchs was established in 1998. It was chosen for in-depth analysis and assessment. The ecosystem assessment framework of interaction between ecosystems and drivers of global change was adopted for the study. The assessment was based on ""before"" and ""now"" scenarios to draw inferences for impact of community-based biodiversity management and sustainability. The wchs provides economic alternatives to converting community-based ecosystems into sustainable economic ventures, including eco-tourism. The number of tourists to wchs that stood at less than 500 persons in 2002 increased to 2,390 persons in 2011. The test of correlation between the number of local and foreign tourists revealed significant (p<0.001; rho=0.926) relationships in the influx of tourists to wchs. This is evident by the increase in revenue that accrued to the wchs. It also generated peaceful cohesion and aesthetics of the environment and development of property rights. The wchs has led to the reduction in poverty and hunger through the generation of incomes, improvement in health through infrastructural provision, and biodiversity sustainability of local species. The case of wchs demonstrates that biodiversity management founded on good communal relationships cannot only improve the livelihoods of the rural poor but also increase their resilience to face challenges as the people become more economically and socially resilient, and empowered to handle future threats to ecological imbalances."

This is particularly true in geographical areas where social/military events drive an under-reported, but potentially lethal, type of human-wildlife interaction. Waterbirds of gharana wetland conservation reserve consist mostly of threatened species. However, as occurs globally, 'protected' fauna near contested borders are sometimes affected by military forces. As part of a larger project to document regional avifauna, we report the seasonal status of waterbirds in order to help establish a baseline for comparing conservation of wildlife within contested areas to that of fauna in more secure refuges. We examined 24 avifauna surveys for relationships between seasons, temperature, individuals and species. Results: 28 of 61 waterbird species were rare. We found seasonal variations in individuals (f3,731=3.82; p<0.01) and species (f3,11=5.81; p<0.05) with a major influx in late winter, rather than autumn. Thus, while this sanctuary serves as an over-wintering site, it is also a stop-over site for high-altitude migrations. While providing this baseline, we offer a reminder that the welfare of wildlife in protected areas should be monitored seasonally, with the ongoing threats to their conservation, carefully documented."

It uses multilevel regression analysis to analyze the variable effects of changes in enforcement-a central mechanism through which the protected ecosystems in sudano-sahelian africa project sought to achieve its objectives-in the w national parks (wnp) of benin and niger. We find that differences in national political context relating to governance quality and extent of democratic decentralization moderated the social-ecological effects of enforcement. Increasing enforcement levels in benin's wnp were associated with significant increases in mammal species abundance while having little average effect on the incomes of households around the park. By contrast, greater levels of enforcement in niger's wnp were associated with sharply decreasing income levels among park neighbors but did not have a statistically significant effect on wildlife populations. These results highlight the importance of national political context to the outcomes of aid-funded conservation efforts. They suggest that state-led pa enforcement will have more positive social-ecological impacts in better-governed, more decentralized countries and that conservation policy centered on pas should therefore devote greater attention to engagement with higher levels of governance."

We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates in a 5-year study at beecroft weapons range in south-eastern australia by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24 sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was similar within versus outside the impact area, although many-individual species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes. Overall, our data indicated that beecroft weapons range maintained considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence, mtas have the potential to make a substantial contribution to conservation outside the formal protected area network. However, managers of mtas need to explicitly state their environmental objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of particular species.

This assemblage has a high biogeographic interest because it harbors species with a large altitudinal spectrum and several high elevation endemic forms (submontane). Those species are currently severely threatened by human expansion in the area. Human impacts include direct collections of several endemic species with a high commercial value for the international pet trade, but most importantly deforestation and the growing encroachment of people, cattle, and agriculture. Efficient actions are urgently needed to preserve this unique heritage for future generations."

The present study investigated alien biodiversity in mediterranean marine caves, both by contributing new records of eastern mediterranean cave aliens, and by reviewing the scattered existing literature; the main goals were to highlight potential impacts and investigate the importance of cave environments for the expansion of alien species. Seven new alien species were found in marine caves of the aegean and ionian seas, raising the total number of aliens reported from mediterranean marine caves to 56 species, classified as molluscs, cnidarians, bryozoans, polychaetes, crustaceans, macroalgae, fishes and tunicates. Most cave aliens (66%) were recorded from the southeastern levantine coasts, specifically from lebanese caves. Shipping and lessepsian migration have been suggested as the main pathways of alien introduction into caves of the mediterranean sea. The comparison of alien cave biodiversity with the updated mediterranean alien inventory (32 species added to the latest inventory) showed similar patterns and trends for species richness, biogeographical origin and major introduction pathways, corroborating previous findings on the high local representativeness of mediterranean cave biodiversity. Alien species seem to have invaded mostly the entrance and semi-dark zones of shallow and/or semi-submerged caves and tunnels, whereas only a few have reached the dark inner sectors or caves of the anchialine type; thus, the unfavourable cave environment seems to be naturally protected from impacts related to opportunistic invasive species, at least to a certain point. Currently there is no research confirming any direct impacts of alien biota on the native cavernicolous one. However, some issues have emerged, implying potential threats that need to be further explored: (i) the presence of a considerable proportion of aliens in most studied marine caves of the southeastern mediterranean basin, (ii) the recently observed population explosion of alien cave-dwelling fishes in the same area, (iii) several indications that alien diversity in marine caves is much higher than we know today. Quantitative surveys and monitoring schemes are needed in order to evaluate potential effects of alien diversity on cave community structure and the role of marine caves as stepping stones for its expansion in the mediterranean."

Lacking information on alien species in certain regions of the world hampers a balanced understanding of invasion processes and efficient data exchange among stakeholders. Current knowledge gaps are in need of urgent concern. We therefore conducted a review on alien animals in xinjiang, an unknown region of invasion ecology. Xinjiang lies in the heartland of the asian continent, covering an area of 1,664,900 km(2). In the past 64 years, 128 alien animal species were recorded in this region, 39% of which became invasive and led to loss of native biodiversity. Most of these species were introduced through diversification of local agriculture and aquaculture. This process was aggravated by improving transportation and flourishing trade. Multiple linear regression models and correlation analysis were run for explaining influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors on status of alien animals: economically developed areas with abundant water resource, oases in particular, were prone to be hotspots of alien animal species in this arid and semi-arid region. This study also revealed that taxonomically biased and lagged research were critical problems that impeded studies on biological invasions in xinjiang, and proposed feasible solutions."

One of the largest impediments to conservation efforts in the pacific region however, is the lack of ecological data and its subsequent effects on the development of feasible and useful recovery plans for threatened species. Without these plans, the understaffed, underfunded and often technically ill-equipped conservation agencies face huge difficulties in planning, prioritizing and conducting conservation activities to adequately protect biodiversity. The fiji sago palm, metroxylon vitiense, is an endemic endangered palm species whose survival is heavily dependent on a feasible species recovery plan. It is geographically restricted and threatened by habitat destruction and overexploitation for thatch for the tourism industry and palm heart consumption by local consumers. Despite its threatened status, m. Vitiense is not currently protected by national or international legislation. Recent field surveys and extensive stakeholder consultation have resulted in the production of a species recovery plan highlighting the importance of the species and advocating sustainable harvesting rather than complete bans to promote conservation. This article summarizes the recovery plan and its current effects on the status of m. Vitiense in fiji. We also discuss the role of different stakeholders in the conservation of m. Vitiense, including the absence of significant behavioral changes by the largest consumer - the tourism industry, and the importance of recovery plans for biodiversity conservation in the pacific."

We investigated the effects of trampling due to tourism on the meiofauna of reef formations on the northeastern coast of brazil. Samples were taken from five paired stations located in two areas on the reef: an area protected since 2004, and an area open to tourist visits. Trampling caused important changes in the meiofaunal assemblage. The densities of the total meiofauna and of the commonest groups were negatively affected in the trampled area. Among the major groups, polychaeta proved to be very sensitive to this disturbance. The meiofauna groups showed different response patterns to trampling depending on the species of algae trampled. Reductions in animal densities were partly attributed to the loss of turf biomass and associated sand caused by trampling, and partly to the direct effect of people stepping on the animals. Considering the importance of meiofauna in the food web as well as its biodiversity, these results highlight the possible negative effects of human trampling on the ecological and economic ""services"" that coral reefs provide."

Protected areas are critical for conserving large carnivores, but increasing human-wildlife conflict, tourism, and human population growth near these sanctuaries may have negative effects on the carnivores within sanctuary borders. Our goals were to investigate how anthropogenic disturbance along the edge of the masai mara national reserve, kenya, influences the demography and space-use of two large carnivore species that engage in intense interspecific competition. Here we document, in one disturbed region of the reserve, a rapid increase in the population size of one large predator, the spotted hyena (crocuta crocuta), but a striking concurrent decline in numbers of another, the african lion (panthera leo). Anthropogenic disturbances negatively affected lion populations, and decreasing lion numbers appear to have a positive effect on hyena populations, indicated here by an increase in juvenile survivorship. We also saw an increase in the number of livestock consumed by hyenas. Our results suggest human population growth and indirect effects of human activity along reserve boundaries may be effecting a trophic cascade inside the reserve itself. These results indicate both top-down and bottom-up processes are causing a shift in the carnivore community, and a major disruption of guild structure, inside the boundaries of one of the most spectacular protected areas in africa."

More than 45 mammal species from 9 orders were traded across all markets; mostly ungulates and rodents. For each market, we determined median body mass, species diversity (game diversity), and taxa that were principal contributors to the total number of carcasses for sale (game dominance). Human population density in surrounding areas was significantly and negatively related to the percentage ungulates and primates sold in markets and significantly and positively related to the proportion of rodents. The proportion of carnivores sold was higher in markets with high human population densities. Proportion of small-bodied mammals (<1 kg) sold in markets increased as human population density increased, but proportion of large-bodied mammals (>10 kg) decreased as human population density increased. We calculated an index of game depletion (gdi) for each market from the sum of the total number of carcasses traded per annum and species, weighted by the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(max)) of each species, divided by individuals traded in a market. The gdi of a market increased as the proportion of fast-reproducing species (highest r(max)) increased and as the representation of species with lowest r(max) (slow-reproducing) decreased. The best explanatory factor for a market's gdi was anthropogenic pressureroad density, human settlements with >3000 inhabitants, and nonforest vegetation. High and low gdi were significantly differentiated by human density and human settlements with >3000 inhabitants. Our results provided empirical evidence that human activity is correlated with more depleted bushmeat faunas and can be used as a proxy to determine areas in need of conservation action. Correlaciones entre los mercados de carne de animales silvestres y la disminucion de la vida silvestre usamos datos numericos de carcasas de especies de vida silvestre vendidas en 79 mercados de carne de animales silvestres, en una region de nigeria y camerun, para evaluar si la composicion de especies de un mercado puede explicarse por medio de presiones antropogenicas y variables ambientales alrededor de cada mercado. Mas de 45 especies de mamiferos de nueve ordenes fueron vendidas en todos los mercados, la mayoria ungulados y roedores. Para cada mercado determinamos el promedio de masa corporal, diversidad de especies (diversidad de presa) y taxones que principalmente contribuyeron al numero total de carcasas en venta (dominancia de presa). La densidad de poblacion humana en las areas colindantes estuvo negativa y significativamente relacionada con el porcentaje de ungulados y primates vendidos en los mercados y positiva y significativamente relacionada con la proporcion de roedores. La proporcion de carnivoros vendidos fue mas alta en los mercados con altas densidades de poblacion humana. La proporcion de mamiferos de pequeno tamano (< 1kg) vendidos en los mercados se incremento conforme se incrementaba la densidad de poblacion humana, pero la proporcion de mamiferos de gran tamano (> 10kg) disminuyo conforme aumento la densidad de poblacion humana. Calculamos un indice de disminucion de presas (idp) para cada mercado, a partir de la suma del numero total de carcasas vendidas por ano y especie, sopesado por la tasa intrinseca de incremento natural (r(max)) de cada especie, dividida por el numero de individuos vendidos en un mercado. El idp de un mercado se incremento conforme lo hizo la proporcion de especies de rapida reproduccion (r(max) mas alta) y conforme disminuyo la representacion de especies con la r(max) mas baja (de baja reproduccion). El mejor factor explicativo para el idp de un mercado fue la presion antropogenica - densidad de carreteras, asentamientos humanos con mas de 3000 habitantes y vegetacion no boscosa. Los idp altos y bajos fueron significativamente diferenciados por la densidad humana y los asentamientos humanos con mas de 3000 habitantes. Nuestros resultados proporcionaron evidencia empirica de que la actividad humana esta correlacionada con la disminucion de especies cazadas y puede usarse como indicador para determinar areas que necesiten acciones de conservacion.

It has seven countries with a population estimate of 64.5 million and a coastline of more than 5400 km with a sea area of 2 million km(2) within their exclusive economic zones (eez). This area is one of the richest productive marine ecosystems in the world and its coastal and oceanic waters are rich in biodiversity and hosts approximately 12,500 species dominated by crustaceans, mollusks and fish. The total annual value of the ecosystem services provided by the cclme is estimated to be around u$11.7 billion. The interaction between the cclme and seasonal change in the ocean-atmospheric dynamics drives the productivity which has a mean annual value for chlorophyll of 1.31 mg chl a/m(3) and 372 g c m(2) yr(-1) for primary productivity, based on seawifs satellite data. This productivity supports abundant fish stocks with catches up to 3 million tonnes per annum being landed from the region. Fish population are dominated by the small pelagics especially sardine (sardina pilchardus), sardinellas (sardinella sp.) And horse mackerels (trachurus sp). Satellite derived measurements from 1997 to 2012 reveal a downward trend in primary production and this decline is accompanied by a net warming of the system and a decrease in the upwelling. The declining trends and variability in biomass of some main target commercial fish species observed during these last year was accompanied by significant fishing pressure together with fluctuations in environmental factors which may have been a key drivers of change. Future studies on the ocean dynamics of the cclme system, its impact on resources, environmental interactions and climate change will have to be closely monitored to ensure effective transboundary management (c) 2015 published by elsevier b.v."

We predicted that differences in fish assemblage composition due to the impact of fragmentation would most strongly affect migratory species, and these effects would be dependent on the interaction between the characteristics of each barrier and the antecedent flow conditions that determine temporal variation in connectivity. These hypotheses were applied to a coastal river network in eastern australia that is fragmented by multiple weirs and dams, including some with passage facilities. How these facilities interact with flow to mediate hydrological connectivity and hence patterns of community structure is unknown. Five distinct assemblages were identified that were associated with different combinations of environmental factors and barrier characteristics (spatial arrangement, passability), and key differences were due to variation in migration traits. Two spatially distinct assemblages were associated with fragmentation by two impassable barriers. However, the migration traits that accompanied these community changes were inconsistent between these groups, and likely reflected effects of barriers near the estuary and in the middle of the stream network on diadromous and freshwater-migratory species, respectively. Two assemblage groups in the vicinity of passable weirs varied temporally as a function of hydrology and the seasonal upstream movement of juvenile diadromous species. The effect of habitat loss in conjunction with fragmentation was evident, with a further assemblage group occurring in reaches where riparian vegetation and instream habitat have been altered by poor management of agriculture. This study indicates that the impact of habitat fragmentation in rivers depends on the interaction of the migration characteristics of biota, temporal variation in hydrology which mediates connectivity, and the location of anthropogenic barriers. Conservation policies aimed at minimizing human impacts on aquatic biodiversity need to jointly account for the separate impacts of habitat fragmentation and habitat loss."

These projected changes may impact biodiversity. This study aims to quantify potential biodiversity impacts of increased wood pellet demand in the south-eastern united states in a spatially explicit manner. We determined differences according to an index of potential species richness (for total, threatened and endemic species and four taxonomic groups) between scenarios of high and low demand for wood pellets, while taking into account potential developments in other wood markets and other land uses. Increased demand for wood pellets was projected to cause both positive and negative biodiversity impacts. Negative shifts in total potential species richness were projected for areas in florida, coastal virginia and north carolina, and parts of the gulf coast. Positive shifts in total potential species richness were projected in parts of oklahoma and arkansas. In some locations, the direction of change differed per taxonomic group, highlighting the importance of analysing different taxonomic groups. Shifts in potential species richness due to increased wood pellet demand were considerably smaller compared to the changes due to other drivers, such as urbanization and increased timber demand. Biodiversity impacts due to wood pellet demand should therefore be considered in the context of other drivers of land-use change and biodiversity loss. Our results provide information that allows policymakers, industry and ngos to focus on areas of concern and take appropriate mitigation measures to limit negative biodiversity impacts and promote positive impacts. The spatially explicit approach presented in this study can be applied to different regions and drivers of land-use change, to show how projected demand for an internationally traded commodity may lead to impacts on land use and biodiversity in the procurement region."

Here, we examined for 14 western indian ocean (wio) continental and island nations the extent of their marine coral reef species, fisheries and marine protected areas (mpas), in the context of their geopolitical and socio-economic connections. We also examined the role of external countries and organisations in collaboration within the region. We found large variation between the different countries in their protected area size, and management, which result from different interests in establishing the mpas, ranging from fisheries management, biodiversity conservation to asserting sovereignty claims. Seventy-four per cent of the 154 mpas in the region belong to island nations; however, the largest mpas in the wio were established by european powers, and include mayotte and glorioso islands (france) and chagos (uk). While the majority of mpas are managed by individual countries, between-country collaboration within and outside the region is key if the aim is to achieve effective conservation of ecosystems and species across the island and mainland nations in the region. This may be advanced by creating transboundary mpas and by regional conservation investment by external powers that benefit from the region's resources."

The ability of existing protected areas (pas) to conserve freshwater species and ecosystems has been little investigated. In this study the freshwater conservation potential of pas was evaluated based on their geospatial attributes and spatial relationship to threats. 2. Specifically, the following questions were addressed: (a) to what extent, if any, do pa drainage network location and size affect the potential of pas to conserve freshwater species and habitats within them?; (B) how are the factors that limit or promote conservation potential distributed in relation to pas across a region?; And (c) what are the broader implications for how pas can be designed and managed to contribute to freshwater conservation around the world? 3. Eight factors that affect freshwater conservation potential for 297 pas within the tennessee and cumberland river basins (us) were analysed. Four of these attributes (connectivity, impervious surface area, agricultural land cover, and upstream storage) showed enough variation across pas such that the effect of pa size, drainage network position, and their interaction on those attributes, was able to be modelled. 4. The results support the hypothesis that pa drainage network location and size affect freshwater conservation potential of pas. Both have a statistically significant effect on each of the four conservation potential attributes, either as a main effect, or through an interaction, although the direction of these relationships is not always intuitive. Of the factors that limit or promote conservation potential, pas appear to be most often affected by land conversion to agriculture and a loss of connectivity. 5. This study underscores the importance of pa managers understanding key internal and external threats so that they can take mitigating or minimizing action, and the need to define pa locations and boundaries within a larger basin context.

We investigate whether there have been changes in dynamic regimes over the last 20 years of two invasive species in the midwestern united states, the multicolored asian lady beetle harmonia axyridis and the soybean aphid aphis glycines. We show by model selection that after its 1993 invasion into the american midwest, the year-to-year population dynamics of h. Axyridis were initially governed by a logistic rule supporting gradual rise to a stable carrying capacity. After invasion of the soybean aphid in 2000, food resources at the landscape level became abundant, supporting a higher year-to-year growth rate and a higher but unstable carrying capacity, with two-year cycles in both aphid and lady beetle abundance as a consequence. During 2005-2007, farmers in the midwest progressively increased their use of insecticides for managing a. Glycines, combining prophylactic seed treatment with curative spraying based on thresholds. This human intervention dramatically reduced the soybean aphid as a major food resource for h. Axyridis at landscape level and corresponded to a reverse shift towards the original logistic rule for year-to-year dynamics. Thus, we document a short episode of major predator-prey fluctuations in an important agricultural system resulting from two biological invasions that were apparently damped by widespread insecticide use. Recent advances in development of plant resistance to a. Glycines in soybeans may mitigate the need for pesticidal control and achieve the same stabilization of pest and predator populations at lower cost and environmental burden."

The present study investigated the distribution patterns of aquatic insect populations in the sentinela stream in biribiri state park, diamantina, minas gerais, brazil, and we correlated the patterns to possible impacts caused by tourists. We sampled the aquatic insect population few days before and few days after the holidays and monthly during the year. Fifteen groups of samples were taken from january through december 2011 at four different sites. For each site, three sub-samples were taken by drifting the entomological net and disturbing the substrate using the kick method. 3601 individuals were collected, and 8 orders and 41 families were identified. Environmental indices showed excellent water quality for sites 1 and 2, which are minimally affected by tourism and average water quality for sites 3 and 4, which are highly impacted by tourism. Three of the four holiday periods analyzed showed a significant decrease in insect abundance after the holiday. The richness and diversity of the aquatic insect fauna did not show seasonal fluctuations, despite differences in stream flow velocity during the dry and rainy periods. Our results indicated that the disturbances caused by tourism affect directly the diversity and abundance of aquatic insects in the sentinela stream. In addition, these insects were suitable for the evaluation of human impacts caused by tourism in the conservation of freshwater ecosystem."

Based on high and highest spatial resolution satellite imagery covering nearly four decades, we employed manual feature digitization as well as rate-of-change statistics automatically derived with the digital shoreline analyses system (dsas) and present oil-industry-induced river bed changes and related coastal dynamics manifested via land erosion or accretion, and thus overall changes in the appearance of the yellow river delta. Over the past 37 years large re-diversions led to net erosion areas with over 13 km of shoreline retreat, and net accretion areas with over 21 km of shoreline advance. The satellite data furthermore enabled an assessment of oil pump development in the delta for the past two decades, indicating a strong expansion of oil extraction activities even in two of the delta's protected nature reserves, taking place at times and locations that indicate noncompliance with national regulations. Overall, the study proves the power of satellite imagery to quantify changes in the coastal zone, and to detect industry related activities; including the monitoring of compliance to restricting regulations. It is especially the freely accessible landsat archives, granting four decades of monitoring, which are of immeasurable value to depict the regions dynamics. With landsat 8 already in orbit and with the up-coming launch of the sentinel-2 satellite, the monitoring concept presented here can be continued into the future. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

The chinese government's thirteenth five-year plan on hydroelectricity development (tfp) has goals to mitigate adverse effects on freshwater biodiversity. These measures are of international importance because china is the largest developer of hydropower projects. Herein we analyse the effects of the existing and planned dams on the fish fauna in the lancang river. Drawing on development documents, the different types of mitigation measures on the proposed cascade of dams are assessed against the goals of the tfp. We find that: (1) migratory species (25% of total) are severely affected and there are few effective mitigation measures to conserve them; (2) a further 20% of species may be affected by lack of thermal pollution control or mitigation of peaking flow releases in the main stream; (3) fortunately, most species (81.14%) can be protected in tributary nature reserves in the lower lancang, but many (54.4%) are inadequately protected in the upper lancang; and (4) none of the 20 dams for which there is information meet all the five tfp conservation goals.

We conducted an empirical study to link the spatial variation of species and environments among forest patches embedded in contrasted agricultural matrices. We compared how forest herb communities responded to spatial environmental gradients and past forest cover. We found low values of beta-diversity in both unfragmented and highly fragmented systems, independently from local and regional diversities. As fragmentation increased, the spatial structure of local plant communities was more complex and spatial effects explained an increasing proportion of beta-diversity, suggesting that the importance of dispersal limitations increased and played out at broad spatial scales. However, where spatio-temporal isolation of forest patches was the highest, local species assemblages could not be explained, suggesting that the metacommunity functioning was disrupted. Where the historical continuity was high, local environmental characteristics explained a significant amount of species assemblages within metacommunities, suggesting habitat-selection processes. Beta-diversity and variations in presenceabsence of species were also influenced by the intensity of landscape management, via the permeability of both forest edges and the matrix. This spatially-explicit analysis of metacommunities revealed that forest fragmentation impacts beta-diversity by altering not only the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes, but also the spatial scales at which they act. These results provide empirical support for the conservation of ancient forests and the maintenance of a high connectedness between fragments within agricultural landscapes."

These objectives, however, may conflict if human activities reduce animal use of protected habitat. In this paper, we present the results of experiments which were carried out in the sumava national park (south bohemia) from april 11 to november 28, 2010. To determine if human disturbance affected the area-use pattern of wild ungulates (red deer and roe deer), we conducted census of faecal pellet groups along two tourist roads (novobreznicka and pramenska) in the region of modrava. On the basis of our findings we determined that anthropogenic disturbance has negative effect on the ability of ungulates to use ecosystems in close proximity to busy tourist routes. Red deer showed a greater level of shyness. We also observed that each of the two species had a preference for a spruce stand of different age."

We sampled the water column in an area with the most persistent occurrence of hypoxia every 4 h for a 24-h period in both years. The amount of hypoxic bottom water differed between 2006 and 2007, with 2006 having more widespread bottom hypoxia than 2007. Large-sized mesozooplankton (>1000 mu m) were more abundant in 2006 and were found in greater abundance and biomass in hypoxic water. Small- (250-500 mu m) and mid-sized (500-1000 mu m) mesozooplankton showed did l variability, but did not appear to respond to hypoxia. The opposite pattern was observed in 2007, where smaller-sized mesozooplankton were dominant and did l variability in this size class was not detected, whereas large- and mid-sized mesozooplankton did show evidence of did l variability in 2007. Using a vital staining technique (neutral red), we found a significantly higher proportion of stained mesozooplankton in oxic, surface waters compared with deep, hypoxic waters. These findings show that mesozooplankton vertical and did distributions differed between a year with widespread, bottom hypoxia and a year with a thin layer of hypoxic water. It remains unclear as to what is driving these size differences, the direct impact of hypoxia on mesozooplankton individual or egg mortality differential predation in the water column or other factors such as more nutrient input related to increases in zooplankton production."

In this paper, i document how the liberalization of trade and agricultural policies in guatemala has undermined the latter set of objectives, thereby compromising domestic food sovereignty and global food security. In particular, i demonstrate how neoliberal policies have undermined maize agriculture and contributed to the loss of crop genetic resources in the guatemalan megacentre' of agricultural biodiversity. In its place, small-scale farmers have been encouraged to conform to the country's purported comparative advantage in non-traditional export crops. The results have been widening inequality, a growing dependence upon imported grain and agrochemicals, environmental degradation and decreased food security."

The importance of biogeographic, climatic, economic, and demographic factors as drivers of this trend is increasingly being realized but as yet there is no consensus regarding their relative importance. Whereas little may be done to mitigate the effects of geography and climate on invasions, a wider range of options may exist to moderate the impacts of economic and demographic drivers. Here we use the most recent data available from europe to partition between macroecological, economic, and demographic variables the variation in alien species richness of bryophytes, fungi, vascular plants, terrestrial insects, aquatic invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Only national wealth and human population density were statistically significant predictors in the majority of models when analyzed jointly with climate, geography, and land cover. The economic and demographic variables reflect the intensity of human activities and integrate the effect of factors that directly determine the outcome of invasion such as propagule pressure, pathways of introduction, eutrophication, and the intensity of anthropogenic disturbance. The strong influence of economic and demographic variables on the levels of invasion by alien species demonstrates that future solutions to the problem of biological invasions at a national scale lie in mitigating the negative environmental consequences of human activities that generate wealth and by promoting more sustainable population growth."

We analyzed data from a 17-year study of the distribution of the non-native argentine ant (linepithema humile) and the native winter ant (prenolepis imparis) in a preserve in northern california (u.s.a.). We conducted logistic regressions and used model selection to determine whether the following variables were associated with changes in the distribution of each species: presence of conspecifics at neighboring sites, distance to development (e.g., roads, buildings, and landscaped areas), proportion of vegetation cover taller than 0.75 m, elevation, distance to water, presence of both species at a site, temperature, and rainfall. Argentine ants colonized unoccupied sites from neighboring sites, but the probability of appearance and persistence decreased as distance to development, vegetation cover, and elevation increased. Winter ants appeared and persisted in sites with relatively high vegetation cover (i.e., highly shaded sites). Presence of the 2 species was negatively associated in sites with high vegetation cover (more winter ants) and sites near development (more argentine ants). Probability of colonization of argentine ants decreased where winter ants were most persistent. At sites near development within the preserve, abundant argentine ant populations may be excluding winter ants. The high abundance of argentine ants at these sites may be due to immigration from suburban areas outside the preserve, which are high-quality habitat for argentine ants. In the interior of the preserve, distance from development, low-quality habitat, and interaction with winter ants may in combination exclude argentine ants. Interactions among the variables we examined were associated with low probabilities of argentine ant colonization in the preserve."

We examined the effect of road disturbance on plant communities by investigating roadside vegetation in the protogenic road ecosystem of the yellow river delta (yrd), china. Specifically, we examined the effect of distance from the road verge and road age on the pattern of plant species richness, diversity, and composition at 17 sites. The results revealed that roads retained higher species richness adjacent to the road verge than far away from the road verge (> 200 m). Additionally, species richness and diversity of roadside plants significantly decreased as the distance from the road verge increased. Plant species richness and diversity increased with road age in majority of prescribed distances, while species richness at the road verge significantly increased with road age and peaked at a road age of 20 years, after which species richness plateaued. A correspondence analysis illuminated that the roadside vegetation primarily consists of non-halophytic native species. The percentage of halophytes increased with the distance from the road verge and decreased with road age. Additionally, different performances of alien and native species in response to road disturbance were observed. Furthermore, it is worth noting that roadside environments provide survival habitats for some threatened species, such as wild soybean. In the present study, both positive and negative effects of roads on the plant community were observed from road construction to the long-term operational phases."

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

This study surveyed 927 households in 16 giant panda reserves in sichuan province, china, to calculate the costs and benefits to households of biodiversity conservation, and the differences for those inside and outside reserves. A multilevel regression model was used to measure the factors influencing the costs and benefits. There are three main findings. First, the direct economic cost for average biodiversity conservation for households inside reserves (1166.83 yuan/year) is significantly higher at the 1% level than for those outside (578.27 yuan/year), while the direct economic benefit for average biodiversity conservation to households living inside reserves (3881.94 yuan/year) is not statistically different than those outside (3653.47 yuan/year). Second, the influence of biodiversity conservation on households is significantly different depending on whether they live inside or outside the reserve, regarding employment opportunities, ties with the outside world, infrastructure, and the community environment. There is also a significant difference between those inside and those outside in perceptions with regard to restrictions in the collection of wild plants and destruction of traditional culture by biodiversity conservation. Third, the factors that affect the costs for and benefits to households of biodiversity conservation include, at the household level, the head of household's education level, village cadres, number of migrant workers, distance from the town market, reserve-based employment, development projects, and ecotourism management participation, and, at the reserve level, establishment time, level of reserve, protective effect, and location."

Modification of hydrological regimes by dam construction can have important consequences for river ecosystems. This study examines the impacts of the construction of two dams, the gezhouba dam and the three gorges dam, on the hydrological regime of the yangtze river in china. Analysis of hydrological change before and after dam construction is investigated by evaluating changes in the medians and ranges of variability of 33 hydrological parameters. Results show that the hydrological impact of the gezhouba dam is relatively small, affecting mainly the medians and variability of low flows, the rate of rise, and the number of hydrological reversals. The closure of the three gorges dam has substantially altered the downstream flow regime, affecting the seasonal distribution of flows, the variability of flows, the magnitude of minimum flows, low-flow pulses, the rate of rise, and hydrological reversals. These changes in flow regime have greatly influenced the aquatic biodiversity and fish community structure within the yangtze river. In particular, populations of migratory fish have been negatively impacted. The results help to identify the magnitudes of hydrological alteration associated with the construction of dams on this important large river and also provide useful information to guide strategies aimed at restoration of the river's ecosystems.

Here, we estimate the distribution of basking sharks on south atlantic continental shelves, and the relative importance of chlorophyll concentration, as a proxy for zooplankton abundance, and temperature in determining habitat suitability for basking sharks at large scales. We used maximum entropy (maxent) and maximum likelihood (maxlike) species distribution modelling to test three hypotheses: the distribution of basking sharks is determined by (1) temperature, (2) chlorophyll concentration, or (3) both chlorophyll and temperature, while considering other factors, such as oxygen and salinity. Off south america, basking shark habitat included subtropical, temperate and cool-temperate waters between approximately 20 degrees s and 55 degrees s. Off africa, basking shark habitat was limited to cool-temperate waters off namibia and southern south africa. Maxlike models had a better fit than maxent models. The best model included minimum chlorophyll concentration, dissolved oxygen concentration, and sea surface temperature range, supporting hypothesis 3. However, of all variables included in the best model, minimum chlorophyll concentration had the highest influence on basking shark distribution. Unlike the north atlantic distribution, the south atlantic distribution of basking sharks includes subtropical and cool-temperate waters. This difference is explained by high minimum chlorophyll concentration off southern brazil as compared to north atlantic subtropical areas. Observations in other regions of the world support this conclusion. The highest habitat suitability for basking sharks is located close to nearshore areas that experience high anthropogenic impact [current zoology 61 (5): 811-826, 2015]."

Floras of surveyed islands/peninsulas contained 9 to 143 species; species area relationship followed the power law model. Species richness did not change between 1979 and 2009, but the proportion of ruderal species doubled during this period. Mean relative turnover rate was 1.17% of species per year.

This comes with a cost - an increase in ocean acidity that is expected to have negative impacts on ocean ecosystems. The reduced ability of phytoplankton and zooplankton to precipitate carbonate shells is a clearly identified risk. The impact depends on the significance of these organisms in southern ocean ecosystems, but there is very little information on their abundance or distribution. To quantify their presence, we used coulometric measurement of particulate inorganic carbonate (pic) on particles filtered from surface seawater into two size fractions: 50-1000 mu m to capture foraminifera (the most important biogenic carbonate-forming zooplankton) and 1-50 mu m to capture coccolithophores (the most important biogenic carbonate-forming phytoplankton). Ancillary measurements of biogenic silica (bsi) and particulate organic carbon (poc) provided context, as estimates of the biomass of diatoms (the highest biomass phytoplankton in polar waters) and total microbial biomass, respectively. Results for nine transects from australia to antarctica in 2008-2015 showed low levels of pic compared to northern hemisphere polar waters. Coccolithophores slightly exceeded the biomass of diatoms in subantarctic waters, but their abundance decreased more than 30-fold poleward, while diatom abundances increased, so that on a molar basis pic was only 1% of bsi in antarctic waters. This limited importance of coccolithophores in the southern ocean is further emphasized in terms of their associated poc, representing less than 1% of total poc in antarctic waters and less than 10% in subantarctic waters. Nasa satellite ocean-colour-based pic estimates were in reasonable agreement with the shipboard results in subantarctic waters but greatly overestimated pic in antarctic waters. Contrastingly, the nasa ocean biogeochemical model (nobm) shows coccolithophores as overly restricted to subtropical and northern subantarctic waters. The cause of the strong southward decrease in pic abundance in the southern ocean is not yet clear. The poleward decrease in ph is small, and while calcite saturation decreases strongly southward, it remains well above saturation (>2). Nitrate and phosphate variations would predict a poleward increase. Temperature and competition with diatoms for limiting iron appear likely to be important. While the future trajectory of coccolithophore distributions remains uncertain, their current low abundances suggest small impacts on overall southern ocean pelagic ecology."

Today, pinewoods represent environmental amenity areas at risk, being under siege from intensive urbanisation. We present an emblematic case study in rome's coastal strip where urban encroachment around pinewoods is somewhat overlooked by urban planning, which may be threatening for their conservation. We studied: (i) changes in land use intensification in the pinewoods' surroundings over the past 60 years (1949-2008), by means of a synthetic index of landscape conservation (ilc) ranging from 0 (maximum level of anthropogenic landscape alteration) to 1 (maximum level of landscape naturalness); (ii) influence of different landscape protection level on land use intensification. Findings show that in areas with low levels of landscape protection, the ilc had been decreasing in the first 100-m surrounding pinewoods, and within the 1-km buffer. The ilc had been rather stable within areas with high levels of landscape protection. Lessons learnt have implications for spatial development strategies to protect coastal pinewoods from external pressures due to future (planned) urban densification in their surroundings."

The study area was surveyed from four-wheel drive vehicles driven at low speed (20-30 km/h) along predetermined transects, stopping frequently at prominent spots. The intention was to detect all the great bustards present in the study area. The great bustard population in castilla y leon during the breeding season of 2008 was 14,025 birds: 5,637 males, 7,760 females and 628 individuals whose sex could not be determined. The population was 34% greater in 2008 than in 1998 when the area surveyed in both censuses is compared. Population increases were recorded in all provinces except for soria, where no birds were observed. Not all local populations within provinces increased: we detected population declines of over 10% in 43 (27%) of the 160 polygons surveyed both in 1998 and 2008, population increases of over 10%. In 93 (58%) polygons, and largely stable populations (changes less than 10%) in 24 (15%) polygons. Provincial increases in bustard numbers were positively correlated with increases in the extent of unirrigated legume crops. The great bustard population in castilla y leon in 2008 was the largest in the world, accounting for 27-32% of the global population and about 47% of the estimated spanish population. The spread of unirrigated legumes, crops that are promoted by agri-environment schemes, may have fostered the observed population increase between 1998 and 2008. A survey of the region every ten years is proposed to monitor future population trends."

We compared captures of foliage-gleaning birds among locations during four periods (spring migration, breeding, post-breeding, and fall migration). Foliage arthropod densities were greatest in the forest understory in all four seasons, but understory vegetation density was greatest in gaps. Foliage-gleaning bird abundance was positively associated with foliage-dwelling arthropods during the breeding (f = 18.5, p < 0.001) and post-breeding periods (f = 9.4, p = 0.004), and negatively associated with foliage-dwelling arthropods during fall migration (f = 5.4, p = 0.03). Relationships between birds and arthropods were inconsistent, but the arthropod prey base seemed to be least important during migratory periods. Conversely, bird captures were positively correlated with understory vegetation density during all four periods (p < 0.001). Our study suggests high bird abundance associated with canopy gaps during the non-breeding period resulted less from high arthropod food resource availability than from complex understory and midstory vegetation structure.

The caves were selected based on tourist numbers and configurations: stick tomato (open, high numbers), alexandra (lockable openings, high numbers) and strawhaven (control; no access). Culture-based survey revealed ascomycota dominance irrespective of sampling area with microascales (trichurus sp.) Being most frequently isolated. Some hypocreales-like sequences belonging to fusarium sp., trichoderma sp. And neonectria sp. (Stick tomato) were cultured only from areas not accessible to tourists. These orders also were detected by dgge assay irrespective of sampling area. The predominance of ascomycota (especially microascales) suggested their important ecological roles in these caves. Culture-independent analysis showed higher shannon fungal diversity values (from its-based dgge profiles) in tourist-accessible areas of these caves than in inaccessible areas with the fungal community banding patterns being substantially different in stick tomato cave. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause of the differences in the fungal communities of stick tomato cave, although cave-related factors such as use, configuration and sediment heterogeneity might have contributed to these differences."

We report the effects of tourist trail-type and -use on the incidence of mammal fieldsigns in a pa in central china. Surveys conducted adjacent to five categories of trail-type and fieldsigns were scored for three duplicates of four 0.5 km transects (=60 transects). Higher trail use along more major trail types were associated with significantly fewer fieldsigns along transects close to trails, compared with more distant transects. Fieldsign scores along transects adjacent to less used, unpaved trails were far less affected. In multiple-regression models, species and guilds exhibited different fieldsign score responses to trail type and use. In general, a paucity of larger mammal (>15 kg) fieldsigns was associated primarily with greater trail use, whereas fieldsign scores for smaller mammals were associated more strongly with human-modified forest types. As international demand for nature-based tourism continues to grow it is important to evaluate openly the consequences of providing public access to protected areas while conserving biodiversity.

Thus, our understanding of vegetation dynamics in newly formed and abandoned deltaic wetlands is still poor. The artificial channel diversion of the mouth of the yellow river in 1996 created conditions that mimic a natural delta lobe shift by increasing freshwater, sediment, and nutrient supply to wetlands along the new yellow river course (nyr) and allowing seawater encroachment in the abandoned yellow river course (oyr). To examine the effects of this river channel shift on the vegetation and seed bank structure, above-ground vegetation and seed bank species richness and diversity were examined from the channel to the marsh interior in wetlands of both oyr and nyr. A total of 17 plant species were found growing across both sites, 9 species were in oyr and 16 species in nyr. Soil depth did not influence seed bank density in oyr, but the seed bank density in the 0-5 cm soil layer was significantly greater than in the 5-10 cm soil layer in nyr. Species diversity of the vegetation and soil seed bank was strongly influenced by soil salinity and hydrology, which varied along the gradient from seaside to river bank. There was a greater separation in species composition between seed bank and vegetation in the oyr than in the nyr. The findings suggest that channel diversion of the yellow river had a significant effect to the above-ground vegetation. However, the species richness and diversity of soil seed banks in the oyr was similar to that of the nyr, indicating that seed banks had a greater tolerance to external disturbance compared with vegetation.

This study examined the temporal genetic consequences of historical river fragmentation by hydroelectric dams on lake sturgeon (acipenser fulvescens rafinesque, 1817), using temporal samples from two ontario river systems. Temporal genetic analyses of samples from the ottawa (dammed) and kenogami (unregulated) river systems were used to (1) compare changes in genetic structure and diversity within and between free-flowing and regulated systems; (2) assess how impoundments have influenced the spatial and temporal genetic structure and diversity within these contrasting systems; and (3) estimate effective population sizes (n-e) in both rivers using temporal genetic estimators. Levels of genetic diversity did not differ between impounded and free-flowing rivers, nor did genetic diversity differ through time within a river system. Levels of genetic divergence over time were similarly minimal. We did, however, detect a 65% decline in effective population size in the impounded ottawa river over two generations. Moreover, over the same time period the ottawa river had substantially lower n-e estimates for lake sturgeon than the free-flowing kenogami river system. This study represents one of the first to observe genetic consequences of fragmentation on lake sturgeon. As such, this work reinforces the importance of maintaining or restoring habitat connectivity and availability for this migratory species, and mitigating other demographic threats that could compound, or be compounded by the effect of reduced genetic variation."

We evaluated large-scale and long-term combined effects of fishing, climate, and economic variables on 2 congeneric clams that inhabit sandy beaches of the pacific (mesodesma donacium) and the atlantic (m. Mactroides) in south america. Bioeconomic and climatic variables, such as coastal sea surface temperature anomalies (ssta) and broad-scale climatic indices (pacific decadal oscillation and atlantic multidecadal oscillation), were related to variations in clam populations in a differential way according to latitude and oceanographic features. For m. Donacium, the nature and sign of the relationships between landings and explanatory predictors markedly differed between bioclimatic units. El nino southern oscillation events negatively affected landings in peru and northern chile, whereas landings increased in southern chile and showed a positive correlation with increasing ssta, suggesting a positive effect at the southernmost edge of the species distribution. Long-term trends in the abundance of m. Mactroides were related to fishing intensity and ssta. As anticipated by basic economic theory, deficit of supply relative to demand, exacerbated by very low harvesting costs, pushed the price up and has driven these clam species to levels close to extinction (anthropogenic allee effect). The lack of response of the stocks to long-term closures suggests that these systems exceeded critical thresholds (tipping points). Information on early warnings of tipping points is needed to help manage coastal shellfisheries that are increasingly threatened by long-lasting and large-scale stressors."

One-hundred-and-fifty-one species of marine puffers were assessed against the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list criteria at a 2011 workshop held in xiamen, china. Here we present the first comprehensive review of puffer geographic and depth distribution, use and trade, and habitats and ecology and a summary of the global conservation status of marine puffers, determined by applying the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list criteria. The majority (77%) of puffers were assessed as least concern, 15% were data deficient, and 8% were threatened (critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable) or near threatened. Of the threatened species, the majority are limited-ranging habitat specialists which are primarily affected by habitat loss due to climate change and coastal development. However, one threatened puffer (takifugu chinensis - cr) and four near threatened puffers, also in the genus takifugu (which contains 24 species total), are wide-ranging habitat generalists which are commercially targeted in the international puffer trade. A disproportionate number of species of conservation concern are found along the coast of eastern asia, from japan to the south china sea, with the highest concentration in the east china sea. Better management of fishing and other conservation efforts are needed for commercially fished takifugu species in this region.

These approaches can involve cultural practices such as reduced tillage, increased use of non-crop plants that provide food and shelter for natural enemies, and intercropping to enhance the abundance and diversity of natural enemies. A major assumption of ecological pest management is that these activities can be equally effective for all insect herbivores. Here, i propose that these strategies may only be effective for a subset of pests and geographic regions because most insect pests have complex evolutionary histories that make them difficult to manage. I discuss how crop domestication and human-mediated migration are major evolutionary events that shape the geography of interactions between plants, herbivores, and natural enemies. Insect herbivores can evolve to be pests through three major modes: 1) herbivores associated with the crop wild ancestor may shift onto the domesticated crop, 2) herbivores may host-shift from native host plants onto an introduced crop, or 3) human-mediated migration can introduce insect pests into new cropping regions. The resulting geographic structure can influence the success of pest management by altering ecological factors such as: species distributions, patterns of biodiversity, community structure, and natural enemy attack rates. I discuss how the different modes of insect pest evolution structure a set of relevant questions and approaches for ecological pest management. By acknowledging how agricultural history and geography shape the ecology and evolution of insect pests, we may collectively develop a better capacity to identify where and how ecological pest management approaches can be most broadly effective."

Many large-bodied vertebrates, especially large apex predators, maintain their associated ecosystems through top-down forcing processes, especially trophic cascades, and megaherbivores also exert an array of strong indirect effects on their communities. Thus, a third possibility for at least some of the pleistocene extinctions is that they occurred through habitat changes resulting from the loss of these other keystone species. Here we explore the plausibility of this mechanism, using information on sea otters, kelp forests, and the recent extinction of steller's sea cows from the commander islands. Large numbers of sea cows occurred in the commander islands at the time of their discovery by europeans in 1741. Although extinction of these last remaining sea cows during early years of the pacific maritime fur trade is widely thought to be a consequence of direct human overkill, we showthat it is also a probable consequence of the loss of sea otters and the co-occurring loss of kelp, even if not a single sea cow had been killed directly by humans. This example supports the hypothesis that the directly caused extinctions of a few large vertebrates in the late pleistocene may have resulted in the coextinction of numerous other species."

Unfortunately they also have diverse and sometimes severe environmental impacts affecting many species, including those that are rare and threatened. To assess the extent to which these industries threaten vascular plants, we reviewed data in the iucn red list for 462 critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable european species. Tourism and recreation were listed as threatening 42 % (194 species) of these species from across 50 families, mostly herbs (70 %). They were listed as threatening plants in 9 of the 10 bioregions in europe and in 25 of the 40 countries assessed. Popular tourism destinations such as the canary islands (41 species) and mainland spain (40 species) had the greatest diversity of species listed as threatened by tourism and recreation. The most common of these threats were trampling (61 species), plant collection (59), the maintenance/construction of tourist infrastructure (43) and habitat degradation due to the urbanisation of tourist sites (13). Additional species assessments and more research on the impacts of tourism and recreation may add to these values. It is clear that these industries pose an important threatening process on plants in europe based on the iucn red list data and hence deserve greater recognition in terms of research, conservation and management."

We present an analysis for current transboundary brown bear (ursus arctos) population management in croatia and slovenia. Slovenia's bear management attempts aimed to reduce human-bear conflicts, by limiting the size and distribution of the bear population, with a relatively frequent use of intervention shooting. In contrast, fewer conflicts occur in croatia and bears have been traditionally managed as a valuable game species, with heavily male-biased trophy hunting. On average 9% of the estimated bear population was removed annually in croatia and 18% in slovenia for the years 2005-2010. In croatia, a greater proportion of adult males were shot than in slovenia (80% vs 47% of total hunted males, respectively). We model a scenario for the shared panmictic population and two scenarios assuming that croatian and slovenian bear populations were spatially closed. When isolated, each countries' policies lead to potentially undesired management directions. The slovenian bear population showed a stable or slightly decreasing trend that maintained its sex and age structure, while the croatian bear population showed an increase in size but with a possible lack of older male bear. The panmictic scenario showed that different management policies buffered each other out with the overall combined population trend being slightly increasing with a sustained age/sex structure. The recent geopolitical refugee crisis has led to the partial erection of border security fencing between the two countries. Our data illustrate how the impacts of constructed fencing put in place to address border security issues may also impact the fate of europe's bear populations and other wildlife species that use shared ecosystems.

In this study, we have examined whether ten years of potential increased human pressures have resulted in significant changes in the macrofaunal assemblages' structure and composition of two mesotidal sandy beaches (cabedelo - urban beach, and quiaios - rural beach) on the european atlantic coast (portugal). Seasonal macrofauna collections were performed at both beaches in two different periods, one in 1999-2000 and another in 2010-2011. The physical variables did not change significantly in both beaches throughout the studied periods, however, the urban beach was subject to an increase of human pressures (tourism and shoreline modifications) over the 10-years interval considered when compared with the rural beach. The univariate community descriptors (total density, species richness and diversity) did not differ significantly among periods for the rural beach. In contrast, temporal differences were found at the most urbanised beach, principally regarding the abundances of the amphipod talitrus saltator and the isopod tylos europaeus, two of the most abundant species at both beaches. Permanova tests enhanced these temporal variations and the simper analysis attributed to these species the main differences found between periods in this beach. Since the physical environment was similar in both periods, the ecological changes were most likely attributed to the increased human pressures observed at the urban beach. Nevertheless, this study highlights the need of further robust and effective impact assessments and long-term studies to better discern between natural and human induced changes on sandy beaches.

Qeshm island located at the strait of hormuz, with an area of 1,491 km(2), is the largest island in the region. This island consists of a number of important natural habitat types including creeks, mangroves, corals, and sandy, muddy, and rocky shores that accommodate diverse marine flora and fauna communities. Two rocky shores were selected at the touristic beaches being visited regularly, and further two control locations selected at pristine shores. Intertidal macroinvertebrates were collected from six microhabitats including rock platforms, cobbles, boulders, crevices, sea walls, and rock pools during two different periods representing high and low tourist seasons. Species richness, density, and assemblage structure in heavily visited shores were compared with that of control locations. Striped barnacles (balanus amphitrite) were present on platforms of all locations, thus the changes in their size were used as the obvious contrast associated with visitor's impact. A total of 70 macroinvertebrate species from 11 phyla were recorded. Significant differences were detected in taxonomic richness, density, and assemblage structure of macroinvertebrates between heavily visited and pristine shores, suggesting that macroinvertebrates were adversely affected by visitors' impact at heavily visited shores. The test of changes in species richness, density, and assemblage structure from high to low seasons yielded mixed results. The significant changes in density and assemblage structure from high to low seasons were only observed in one heavily visited shore. A significant reduction in size of striped barnacles was observed only in one heavily visited shore. The opportunistic or fugitive species (e.g., small macroalgae and barnacles) were dominant macroinvertebrates on heavily visited shores indicating early succession stage. The results presented here showed that macroinvertebrates were adversely affected by human activities in subtropical rocky shore."

It is considered an important hotspot of biodiversity and as such is covered by protection status. Purpose in order to check the environmental condition of the lake and determine the spatial distribution and source of organochlorine pesticides (ocps), we performed a detailed soil and sediment sampling campaign with the catchment and dry lake bottom. Methods we present the first environmental evaluation of its current state with respect to ocps: hexachlorobenzene (hcb), hexachlorocyclohexanes (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-hch), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddt) and its metabolites (dde and ddd), and cyclodienes (aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, endrin aldehyde, endrin ketone, alpha-chlordane, gamma-chlordane, endosulfan i, endosulfanii, endosulfan sulphate, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide b and metoxichlor). Results some of the compounds showed concentrations above the soil screening levels (ssls) for human health and ecosystems: gamma-hch (100 mu g/kg), alpha-hch (60 mu g/kg), endrin (30 mu g/kg), aldrin (30 mu g/kg) and heptachlor epoxide b (30 mu g/kg). Various indices were used to determine the origin of the compounds. Conclusion historical uses were interpreted, although there were traces of recent input. Distribution maps of concentration and indices demonstrate a relationship between farming and cropping and the maxima observed, being possible that ocps have influence in living beings, especially birds."

Collisions with windows are the second leading human cause of mortality for birds, and it is estimated that 100 million to one billion birds die due to window collisions annually in the us alone. However, in brazil there have been no systematic studies on bird mortality due to collisions with man-made structures. Our aims with this study were to record the bird species that died due to collisions with windows in an important bird area of southeastern brazil, accessing the effects of species characteristics (forest dependence, wing type, threaten status, endemism, migratory habits) and climatic seasonality on bird-window collisions. Dead birds were collected daily during 2010 to 2013 and occasional records were obtained from 2000-2009 and 2014-2015 in reserva particular do patrimonio natural santuario do caraca, minas gerais, southeastern brazil. We found 168 birds individuals of 57 species dead due to collisions against windows. Individuals classified as forest dependent and with elliptical type wings were the most common among birds dead due to collisions. There was no difference between the number of dead individuals in the dry and rainy seasons, and rainfall was not correlated with bird collisions. The occurrence of threatened, endemic and migrant species in our sample demonstrates the importance to continue this type of research in brazil and other localities throughout the neotropics. Our data can support studies that investigate the influence of other factors and characteristics of natural history of bird collisions, particularly in areas with similar man-made structures as at our study site."

Considerations of the species pool, the number and identity of functional traits and the metrics used to identify patterns have come under scrutiny as possible influences on the detection of non-random patterns. Most mechanistic explanations of community assembly based on functional and phylogenetic approaches rely on deterministic explanations, while ignoring the role of stochastic processes and historical contingency, despite the prominent historical role of both types of explanations of species coexistence. We evaluated the phylogenetic and functional structure of 20 temperate forest bird assemblages in northeastern north america. We compared three approaches for characterizing the functional structure of assemblages. Regardless of approach, assemblages were generally no different than expected by chance. In contrast, phylogenetic structures of bird assemblages were overdispersed, clumped or consistent with random assembly depending on the site. Nonetheless, we found little evidence for differences in phylogenetic structure arising as a consequence of the identity of the species pool. We identified a strong relationship between the proportion of residents and phylogenetic relatedness that was unrelated to the species richness of assemblages. Our results suggest that different assembly mechanisms may structure resident and migratory subsets of temperate breeding bird communities. Resident assemblages are likely structured by interspecific interactions and habitat filtering prior to arrival of migrants. In contrast, the composition of migrant assemblages may be a consequence of priority effects in which the presence and abundance of residents and earliest arriving species affect the ability of subsequent migrants to colonize sites. This phenomenon enhances the likelihood of multiple alternative community structures in similar environments."

The results indicate that the total mined area in 2013 was 22 km(2) and is predicted to escalate. Results also show that the ecosystems in fengxian county, shaanxi province and baokang county, hubei province were most severely affected by mining. Urbanization in the qin-ba mountainous area has seen an increase of 85.58 km(2) in urban land use from 2010 to 2013. In addition, infrastructure development including airport construction, tourism resorts and real estate development in the qin-ba mountainous area has intensified environmental and biodiversity disturbances since large areas of forest have been cleared.

Aquaculture in the lake began decades ago, with many changes in the lake ecosystem having occurred since that time. Most dominant species for fish culture are introduced species. Other invasive species were also introduced to the lake as escapees from land-based aquaculture facilities. This study was conducted to monitor fish diversity in two adjacent, but distinctly different, sites in the lake, namely an open fishery area (ofs), with no adjacent aquaculture structures, and an aquaculture site (aqs), with cages for the culture of various commodities. Fish traps were installed at both sites, with the traps being sampled at least every 2weeks from april 2013 to february 2015. The results of pairwise t-tests indicated significantly higher shannon-wiener diversity index (h), evenness (j), simpson's similarity index (d) and species richness (s) in ofs than in aqs. In terms of total catch per day, significantly greater fish biomass were obtained from aqs than from ofs. Introduced aquaculture species had a mean dominance of 83% and 47% in aqs and ofs, respectively. However, invasive species introduced from the ornamental fish trade exhibited a mean relative dominance of 10.3% in aqs and 13.5% in ofs. The relative dominance of native species was also significantly higher in ofs (41%) than in aqs (6.5%). The results of this study demonstrated the adverse impacts of aquaculture in regard to the species diversity of fish in localized areas in laguna de bay. The dependency of aquaculture on introduced fish species adversely impacted the natural fish population in the lake. Focusing on the culture of commercially important local species for aquaculture, rather than introduced species, will improve fish production of inland waters without accompanying adverse impacts on biodiversity."

Many of the generalist species in this matrix are increasingly traded in the bushmeat markets of west and central africa. However, to date there has been little quantification of how the spatial configuration of the landscape influences the urban bushmeat trade over time. As anthropogenic landscapes become the face of rural west africa, understanding the dynamics of these systems has important implications for conservation and landscape management. The bushmeat production of an area is likely to be defined by landscape characteristics such as habitat disturbance, hunting pressure, level of protection, and distance to market. We explored (ssg, tense) the role of these four characteristics in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the commercial bushmeat trade around the city of kumasi, ghana, over 27 years (1978 to 2004). We used geographic information system methods to generate maps delineating the spatial characteristics of the landscapes. These data were combined with spatially explicit market data collected in the main fresh bushmeat market in kumasi to explore the relationship between trade volume (measured in terms of number of carcasses) and landscape characteristics. Over time, rodents, specifically cane rats (thryonomys swinderianus), became more abundant in the trade relative to ungulates and the catchment area of the bushmeat market expanded. Areas of intermediate disturbance supplied more bushmeat, but protected areas had no effect. Heavily hunted areas showed significant declines in bushmeat supply over time. Our results highlight the role that low intensity, heterogeneous agricultural landscapes can play in providing ecosystem services, such as bushmeat, and therefore the importance of incorporating bushmeat into ecosystem service mapping exercises. Our results also indicate that even where high bushmeat production is possible, current harvest levels may cause wildlife depletion."

Migratory ungulates are especially vulnerable to impacts of changing land use outside protected areas on their abundance. Range compression may compromise the capacity of migrants to cope with climatic variation, and accentuate both competitive interactions and predation. We analyzed the population dynamics of 11 ungulate species within kenya's nairobi national park, and compared them to those in the adjoining athi-kaputiei plains, where human settlements and other developments had expanded. The migratory wildebeest decreased from almost 30,000 animals in 1978 to around 5,000 currently but the migratory zebra changed little regionally. Hartebeest, impala, eland, thomson's gazelle, grant's gazelle, waterbuck, warthog and giraffe numbers declined regionally, whereas buffalo numbers expanded. Bimonthly counts indicated temporary movements of several species beyond the unfenced park boundaries, especially during very wet years and that few wildebeest entered the park during the dry season following exceptionally wet conditions in 1998. Wildebeest were especially vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts in their wet season dispersal range on the plains. Deterioration in grassland conditions in the park following high rainfall plus lack of burning may have discouraged these animals from using the park as a dry season refuge. Our findings emphasise the interdependency between the park and the plains for seasonal wildlife movements, especially in exceptionally dry or wet years. To effectively conserve these ungulates, we recommend implementation of the new land-use plan for the athi-kaputiei plains by the county government; expansion of the land leasing program for biodiversity payments; collecting poacher's snares; negotiation and enforcement of easements, allowing both wildlife and livestock to move through the athi-kaputiei plains, providing incentives for conservation to landowners; and improving grassland conditions within the park through controlled burning so that more wildlife can gain protection there."

Numerous anthropogenic activities and processes are considered responsible for such declines, including tourism related activities. These activities often occur in global biodiversity hotspots but few studies consider the potential risks associated with tourism. The relative importance of tourism as a threat to birds was quantified using a global analysis of the threats facing critically endangered and endangered birds in the hotspots. Sixty-three critically endangered and endangered bird species are reportedly threatened by tourism. Among those 63 species, marine, coastal and aquatic birds are threatened more by tourism than was expected. Hotspots with the most species threatened by tourism are polynesia-micronesia and the mediterranean basin. This study uses individual threatening processes in a new way to characterise hotspots for conservation action, advancing previous identification criteria. Analysing hotspots in terms of the relative presence of individual threatening processes may help to more effectively direct future research in these priority regions."

Few studies have documented the extraction volumes for illicitly traded orchids, the status of the populations affected by this activity, the socioeconomic profiles of the vendors, or the factors determining income, which are essential for designing strategies to conserve this resource. We documented species richness, abundance, and prices for orchids traded during december in traditional markets in chiapas, mexico. The relationships among price, species showiness, and some variables determining income were evaluated. We recorded 28 traded species, all of which were extracted from neighboring, protected, and high-biodiversity forests. The most income was generated from three species, which were also the most abundant in the markets. This trade affects the conservation of two threatened mexican orchids, but at a state level, it also impacts populations of other species that are not considered at risk. A significant relationship was found between the price of an orchid and its flower size and between the vendor's income and the quantity of orchids traded by him. The income obtained by a vendor was significantly explained by orchid inflorescence abundance, vendor's age, and a biodiversity index estimated here."

Interactions between invasive and indigenous taxa across trophic levels often tend to propagate throughout the ecosystem, but also those at the same trophic level may affect biodiversity. Here, we examine faunal interactions between an invasive asian morph of the cerithioidean gastropod melanoides tuberculata and indigenous gastropods in long-lived lake malawi. Studying quantitative samples, we document a negative spatial correlation between the established invader and endemic melanoides species, and positive ones between invasive and native m. Tuberculata, and between native melanoides and schistosome-transmitting bulinus. Comparison of modern and fossil samples indicates that melanoides communities have changed since the middle holocene from consisting predominantly of endemic taxa (95%) toward a dominance by non-endemics (80%). External evidence suggests that ecosystem change, such as increased sedimentation and eutrophication, and interactions between the invasive and endemic melanoides species are the most likely causes for these changes. More in-depth study of the benthic ecosystem is required to document interaction mechanisms better, but the invasive taxon is playing an important role in reshaping communities and diversity in lake malawi."

Biomonitoring of the disturbed area and a control station shows that elevated temperature is a more significant stressor compared to salinity, thus causing a decrease in abundance and richness. Critical temperature thresholds were observed at 30 and 35 degrees c, the latter representing the most thermally tolerant species in the studied area pararotalia calcariformata, which is the only symbiont-bearing species observed within the core of the heated area. Common species of the shallow hard-bottom habitats including several lessepsian invaders are almost absent in the most exposed site indicating that excess warming will likely impede the survival of these species that currently benefit from the ongoing warming of the eastern mediterranean.

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

Axis deer (axis axis) and wild boar (sus scrofa) are of increasing concern in multiple regions. A management program reduced wild boar abundance and soil damage below target levels through controlled still shooting from watchtowers and dog-hunting performed by recreational hunters at el palmar national park, argentina. Here we assess program impacts on axis deer over a 10-year period in which 2380 deer were dispatched, and document two largely unexpected outcomes: increasing axis deer abundance toward a plateau, and a strong inverse correlation between deer and wild boar numbers. Unlike the initial steep decline and subsequent stabilization of wild boar, deer abundance indexed by standardized catchper-unit-effort increased at 37.6% per year over 0-5 years post-intervention (ypi) and stabilized from 7 ypi on when still-shooting effort averaged 948 hunting party-hours per quarter. Deer catch was non-linearly related to still-shooting effort. Timing of deer and boar catches did not differ significantly regardless of sex, season and ypi. Catch-per-unit-effort indices and nightly spotlight deer counts showed similarly increasing trends. The fraction of older adult deer declined over 0-4 ypi and remained stable thereafter. Sex ratios were consistently skewed toward males only among older adults. Failure to reduce deer abundance may be explained by several major processes: protracted exponential growth of the deer population after park invasion; deer regional expansion with increasing immigration; insufficient sex- and stage-biased hunting mortality, and competitor (and perhaps predator) release from wild boar."

Some species are tolerant or even benefit from environmental conditions such as ocean warming, acidification, and eutrophication. In consequence, increases in sponge bioerosion have been observed on some coral reefs over the last decades. The abrolhos bank is the largest coral reef system in the south atlantic. It has been affected by sedimentation, eutrophication, overfishing, and climate change, mainly affecting coastal reefs, and at lesser intensity outer ones as well. This study aimed to describe spatial and temporal patterns in bioeroding sponge distribution in carbonate substrates in the abrolhos bank. Photo-quadrats were used to compare bioeroding sponge abundance between two shallow reefs: a coastal, pedra de leste (pl), and an outer reef, parcel dos abrolhos (pab). Each individual was delimitated over the substrate by determining the sponge surface through a line connecting the outermost papillae. The study was conducted over 6 years in 2008-2009 and 2013-2016. Four species of bioeroding sponges were identified: cliona carteri ridley, 1881, c. Delitrix pang, 1973, c. Cf. Schmidtii ridley, 1881, and siphonodictyon coralliphagum rutzler, 1971. The distribution and abundance of species varied between the inner and outer reefs and across the years, and displayed certain selectivity for the calcareous substrates recorded. Crustose coralline algae (cca) were the main substrate excavated by the most abundant bioeroding species, c. Carteri, and represented 70% of the substrate types occupied by this sponge (cca, coral overgrown by cca and plain coral). The highest abundance of bioeroding sponges observed in photo-quadrats was 21.3 individuals/m(2) at the outer reefs (pab) in 2014. The abundances or areal extents of bioeroding sponges were up to 10 times greater on the outer reefs than on the coastal ones, where sedimentation is higher and more strongly influenced by siliciclastic material. Moreover, a higher herbivorous fish biomass has been reported on outer reefs which could also influence the higher abundance of bioeroding sponges in outer reefs. During the study period of 6 years, an increase in bioeroding sponge abundance was observed at the outer reefs (pab), with the sea surface temperature increase. As cca have an important role in reefal cementation and carbonate production in the abrolhos reefs, a bioerosion impact might be expected, in particular, on the outer reefs."

Historically, low-impact intrusion into species habitats arose from local demands for food, fuel and living space(3). However, in today's increasingly globalized economy, international trade chains accelerate habitat degradation far removed from the place of consumption. Although adverse effects of economic prosperity and economic inequality have been confirmed(4,5), the importance of international trade as a driver of threats to species is poorly understood. Here we show that a significant number of species are threatened as a result of international trade along complex routes, and that, in particular, consumers in developed countries cause threats to species through their demand of commodities that are ultimately produced in developing countries. We linked 25,000 animalia species threat records from the international union for conservation of nature red list to more than 15,000 commodities produced in 187 countries and evaluated more than 5 billion supply chains in terms of their biodiversity impacts. Excluding invasive species, we found that 30% of global species threats are due to international trade. In many developed countries, the consumption of imported coffee, tea, sugar, textiles, fish and other manufactured items causes a biodiversity footprint that is larger abroad than at home. Our results emphasize the importance of examining biodiversity loss as a global systemic phenomenon, instead of looking at the degrading or polluting producers in isolation. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate better regulation, sustainable supply-chain certification and consumer product labelling."

While many species of animals feed directly on salmon carcasses each autumn, salmon-derived nutrients can also be stored in coastal habitats throughout the year. The effects of this storage legacy on vertebrates in other seasons are not well understood, especially in estuaries, which can receive a large portion of post-spawning salmon nutrients. We examine the effects of residual salmon-derived nutrients, forest habitats and landscape features on summer breeding birds in estuary forests. We compared models containing environmental variables and combined chum (oncorhynchus keta) and pink (oncorhynchus gorbuscha) salmon biomass to test predictions concerning bird density and diversity. We discovered that total bird, insectivore, golden-crowned kinglet and pacific wren densities and shannon's diversity in the summer were strongly predicted by salmon biomass in the autumn. For most metrics, this relationship approaches an asymptote beyond 40 000 kg of salmon biomass. Foliage height diversity, watershed catchment area and estuary area were also important predictors of avian communities. Our study suggests that the legacy of salmon nutrients influences breeding bird density and diversity in estuaries that vary across a wide gradient of spawning salmon biomass."

In australia alone there are 184 orchids identified as threatened by the australian government, but what threatens them and where are they threatened? Using data derived from listing documents for these orchids, threats were allocated to 28 categories. Then, the distributions of the orchids and hence likely geographic patterns of threats were mapped using 14,651 location records from the atlas of living australia. The most common threats were changes in fire regimes (74% of threatened australian orchids), invasive species (65%), habitat modification (64%), grazing (63%), tourism and recreation (47%) and illegal collection (46%), which often co-occurred as threat syndromes. Most threatened orchids are terrestrial (165 species), and many occur in temperate forests (96) and temperate shrubland (36). When generalised linear models were used to assess geographic patterns in threats, bioregions with less cover of native vegetation were more likely to have orchids threatened by habitat modification, grazing or weeds (p < 0.05). Bioregions with higher protected area coverage were more likely to contain orchids threatened by tourism and recreation, but less likely to have orchids threatened by habitat modification (p < 0.05). Understanding drivers of threats and their distribution is crucial for successful management as they highlight key areas for conservation. The results also highlight the need for updating orchid listings nationally and internationally to better reflect the diversity of orchids threatened and threats to them, including the increasing impact of climate change."

Southern african countries make an important contribution to elephant conservation and could soon become the last stronghold of elephant conservation in africa. While the ecological factors affecting elephant distribution and densities have extensively been accounted for, there is a need to understand which socioeconomic factors affect elephant numbers in order to prevent conflict over limited space and resources with humans. We used elephant count data from aerial surveys for seven years in a generalized linear model, which accounted for temporal correlation, to investigate the effect of six socioeconomic and ecological variables on the number of elephant at the country level in the greater mapungubwe transfrontier conservation area (gmtfca). Important factors in predicting elephant numbers were the proportion of total land surface under cultivation, human population density and the number of tourists visiting the country. Specifically, elephant numbers were higher where the proportion of total land surface under cultivation was the lowest; where population density was the lowest and where tourist numbers had increased over the years. Our results confirm that human disturbance is affecting elephant numbers, but highlight that the benefits provided by ecotourism could help enhance elephant conservation. While future studies should include larger areas and more detailed data at the site level, we stress that the development of coordinated legislation and policies to improve land-use planning are needed to reduce the impact of increasing human populations and agriculture on elephant."

Drawing on fieldwork in mexico, cross disciplinary literature review and web-based research, we globally examined how ideas of paradise along with commodification of plant resources influence touristic use of plant-based construction materials. In contrast with declining subsistence use of forest-based building materials, thatched huts have become a prevalent element of tropical tourism architecture. We documented the use of 148 plant taxa in 31 tropical and subtropical countries on 4 continents. The emergence of thatched architecture in tourist contexts represents not only a scale-up in the demand of plant-based materials, but often resulted in changes in the species utilized, resource management regimes and governance, architectural uses, and often a partial or total substitution for synthetic look-alike materials. We identified four factors distinctive to the growing commercial versus declining subsistence presence of thatched hut architecture: (1) local regulations in forest product uses and building and urban development codes, (2) prevalence of aesthetic values over material authenticity and structural efficacy, (3) greater dependency on unpredictable economic and tourist destination cycles, and (4) greater maintenance needs in environments highly vulnerable to decay and extreme weather. Our pluralistic approach of examining the iconic thatch hut through diverse disciplinary perspectives facilitated identification of multiple facets of commonly overlooked forest product use and biodiversity consumption in tropical tourism."

Recreational ecosystem services like wildlife tourism are specific cultural ecosystem services that often involve relationships between the supply of opportunities to interact with biodiversity and the demand of wildlife tourists. Here, we first investigated whether different biodiversity measures based on three metrics applied to four components of large mammal diversity influenced the distribution of visitors within four protected areas (pas) in southern africa. Second, we explored whether these effects were context-specific across the four pas. We counted large mammals and visitor numbers along 196 road transects to test these relationships. All species-mammal diversity metrics related positively to visitor numbers. Subsets of mammal diversity were also positively associated with the distribution of visitors in all pas. Relationships between supply and demand for the recreational service of wildlife tourism were mainly context-specific: the relationships between biodiversity measures and visitor numbers differed among pas. Our results could help managers to optimize the use of recreational services within pas, by diversifying viewing opportunities while reducing disturbance to wildlife. The supply-demand approach presented here offers promising avenues for further assessments of recreational ecosystem services. (C) 2017 elsevier b.v. All rights reserved."

The antarctic represents a microcosm of the situation, with the numbers of established non-native species growing. Information to help reduce potential impacts is therefore critical. We measured the propagule load of seeds, and fragments of bryophytes and lichens (the number of other plant or animal fragments was too low to draw any conclusions) carried in the clothing and gear of visitors to the antarctic, during the 2007108 austral summer. Samples were collected from different categories of visitors associated with national research programs and tourism and different categories of clothing and gear, new as well as used. We also collected information about the timing of travel and the regions visitors had travelled to prior to antarctic travel. Seeds were found in 20% and 45% of tourist and science visitor samples, respectively. For bryophyte and lichen fragments the proportions were 11% and 20%, respectively. Footwear, trousers and bags belonging to field scientists were the highest risk items, especially of those personnel which had previously visited protected areas, parklands/botanic gardens or alpine areas. Tourists who visited rural/agricultural areas prior to travel, and/or travel with national programs or on smaller tourist vessels had the highest probability of transferring plant propagules. Travel either during the boreal or austral autumn months increased the probability of propagule presence. Our assessment is applicable to other areas given evidence of propagule transfer patterns in those areas that are broadly similar to those documented here. The current work provides a sound evidence base for both self-regulation (e.g. Taking care of personal equipment) and organization-based regulation (e.g. Issuing guidelines and holding regular inspections) to reduce propagule transfer of plants to the antarctic.

Detailed analysis of introductions of those species with records after 1900 present in both areas shows that delays were up to 100 years for species introduced on the iberian peninsula at the beginning of the twentieth century, but the tendency adjust to a decreasing linear regression, with species introduced after 1995 being almost immediately present in galicia. We underline the outstanding role of aquarium trade on these results. Analysis of temporal trends highlights several periods with numerous introductions, and shows a different trend in the last decade depending on the group of organisms, with a clear deceleration in introduction rates of vertebrates, but a continuous growing trend for invertebrates. Recent educational programs might be responsible for the reduction in the inflow of vertebrates, but there is still a need for the control of less conspicuous but equally harmful invertebrates and plants, as it will take longer to make both stakeholders and public aware of their detrimental effects on their new habitats."

One way that humans have triggered wildlife declines is by transporting disease-causing agents to remote areas of the world. Amphibians have been hit particularly hard by disease due in part to a globally distributed pathogenic chytrid fungus (batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [bd]). Prior research has revealed important insights into the biology and distribution of bd; however, there are still many outstanding questions in this system. Although we know that there are multiple divergent lineages of bd that differ in pathogenicity, we know little about how these lineages are distributed around the world and where lineages may be coming into contact. Here, we implement a custom genotyping method for a global set of bd samples. This method is optimized to amplify and sequence degraded dna from noninvasive skin swab samples. We describe a divergent lineage of bd, which we call bdasia3, that appears to be widespread in southeast asia. This lineage co-occurs with the global panzootic lineage (bdgpl) in multiple localities. Additionally, we shed light on the global distribution of bdgpl and highlight the expanded range of another lineage, bdcape. Finally, we argue that more monitoring needs to take place where bd lineages are coming into contact and where we know little about bd lineage diversity. Monitoring need not use expensive or difficult field techniques but can use archived swab samples to further explore the history-and predict the future impacts-of this devastating pathogen."

Utilising water that would otherwise be lost from the vicinity allows the creation of multi-strata orchards with higher plant densities than the surrounding environment. We used pitfall traps to compare ground arthropod communities within 15 agricultural gardens to those in the external habitat. Total arthropod abundance and species richness were significantly higher inside the gardens, with no loss of alpha-diversity. Species level analysis of ants revealed that six out of seven recorded species were more abundance inside the gardens. There were significant differences in the responses of coleopteran functional groups, with scavengers occurring in higher numbers inside, predators higher outside, and herbivores showing no difference. There was a high presence of the ant monomorium venustum and the scavenger beetle lagria sp. Inside the gardens, but no negative impacts on species accumulation rates or alpha-diversity. In conclusion, runoff agroforestry seems to enhance local arthropod abundance, without a strong negative affect on biodiversity. Crown copyright (c) 2012 published by elsevier b.v.

Trade in wildlife products is driven by consumer demand; however, consumer's motivations are often poorly understood. In this study, we use mixed social science approaches to understand the motivations driving consumers of bear products for medicine in vietnam, and of traditional medicine practitioners who may be influencing consumers. In addition, we provide current information about the ways bear products are used in the two largest cities of vietnam: hanoi and ho chi minh city. We found that bear products are still used widely in vietnam, despite their use being prohibited since 2006. We directly estimated use at 45% of the sample of consumers for hanoi, and 18% for consumers in ho chi minh city. However, bear products are used differently between the two cities, with hanoians more likely to take bear medicine products to treat an ailment, versus ho chi minh city, where it is taken as a daily tonic. We also found that some traditional medicine practitioners in vietnam are continuing to prescribe bear products, despite medicinal prescription of bear bile being made illegal, and availability of traditional medicine herbal alternatives. Generally, use of bear products appears to still be widely acceptable in the country, indicating a need for changing the social norms of bear product consumption. The insights gathered here will be beneficial to conservation managers working in vietnam and throughout the southeast asia region, and will be particularly informative for developing and implementing demand reduction campaigns."

This phenomenon could be inhibited by large herbivores through selective browsing that reduces shrub growth. Our objective was to assess the dynamics of shrub species in the deception bay area, in nunavik (quebec, canada), a region in the summer range of the riviere-aux-feuilles migratory caribou herd. We surveyed abundance and stem mortality of all shrub species along systematically located transects in a 54 km(2) area. Our results showed that shrubs covered 11.5% of the area, and were dominated by prostrate betula glandulosa (8.7%). Stem mortality of established individuals was greater for salix planifolia (45.6%) and salix glauca (46.5%) than for b. Glandulosa (9.3%). Using dendrochronological analysis, we determined the age structure of the two dominant erect shrub species in ten 10 m x 10 m plots. We recorded a high number of b. Glandulosa and, to a lesser extent, of s. Planifolia recruits (71.0 and 4.6 per 100 m(2), respectively) established after 1999, when the riviere-aux-feuilles herd was abundant. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that large herbivores counteracted the positive effects of climate change on shrub recruitment. However, since the structure of the recruits are prostrate rather than erect, as is usually observed with shrub expansion in the warming arctic, it is likely that herbivory, and/or, the harsh climate, is constraining habitat change."

The freshwater aquarium trade provides economic and livelihood opportunities to the rural poor, but has been implicated in biodiversity loss through population declines and local extirpation of high-value endemic species. Previous observations on population declines are largely based on anecdotal data, however, and there are no studies on the population dynamics or stock assessment of freshwater fish species collected for the aquarium pet trade. 2. To understand how wild collection of endemic and threatened species for the aquarium trade could affect their populations, the sustainability of collecting the endangered redline torpedo barb (sahyadria denisonii), and its evolutionarily distinct lineages (henceforth rltbs), from the western ghats region (part of the western ghats-sri lanka biodiversity hot spot) for the aquarium trade was studied to provide baseline data to inform conservation action. 3. Local populations of rltbs at the five commercial collection sites showed high mortality rates, and fish were exploited before they attained sexual maturity. The unmanaged fishery has led to unsustainable levels of exploitation, and populations of rltbs at three sites are vulnerable to an impending collapse. 4. Endemic and threatened freshwater fish species used in the aquarium pet trade are exposed to local extirpations and global extinctions unless management plans and legislative controls are implemented and strictly enforced. Management plans and conservation actions to help guide the responsible fisheries of rltbs are suggested, and the wider implications of unmanaged exploitation of endemic aquarium fisheries are discussed."

In this connection, we assessed the state of the bat colonies in relation to tourist abundance and behaviour in the devetashka cave, bulgaria. The cave is of european importance for bat conservation and houses more than 10,000 bats in the summer. However, during the weekends it is subject to an enormous tourist flow consisting of 500-1000 persons per day. In order to estimate the tourist factor, the number of people, whether flashlights and photoflashes were used and the maximum noise produced were recorded during observation sessions. Bat abundance, activity and adult and juvenile mortality were recorded in order to track the condition of the bat colonies. We discovered a strong positive relationship between the number of visitors to the cave and bat mortality (r = 0.569, p < 0.05). Light was the tourist factor with highest negative influence on the colonies. The extent of tourist influence on the bats is discussed and necessary measures to reduce it are suggested. Cave tours will need a special consideration, so that they can be designed to minimize as much as possible the detrimental effect human activity has on bats, thus the visitation regime of the devetashka cave will be revised based on the findings of this study."

Genetic biodiversity is a key component of biological variation, but despite scientific knowledge and far-reaching political goals, genetic biodiversity remains neglected in marine management. Previous research highlights lack of knowledge among managers as one explanation to the implementation deficit. This multidisciplinary study builds on the identified need for an improved knowledge transfer between science and ongoing management. A basic knowledge package on genetic biodiversity in the baltic sea was presented as either a lecture or a deliberative group discussion to two separate samples of public managers who are involved in baltic sea and other biodiversity management at the regional level in sweden. The empirical findings show that the communicated information has an impact on the public managers' beliefs on genetic biodiversity of the baltic sea. Lectures seem more efficient to transfer knowledge on this theme. Those who received information through a lecture strengthen their confidence in area protection as a management tool to conserve genetic diversity. They were also more convinced of the obligation of authorities at national and regional level to take on larger responsibility for genetic conservation than those managers who participated in a deliberative discussion."

Here, we apply knowledge on human attitudes to an interesting socio-ecological system, the case of mitigating the devastating infectious amphibian disease chytridiomycosis in the pyrenean mountains, a touristic region. We conducted a questionnaire survey directly in mountain areas (n = 418) and on the internet (n = 868) to investigate whether attitudes towards amphibians influenced support of five possible conservation actions. We further analyzed whether attitudes were influenced by peoples' use of the mountains, their socio-economic backgrounds, and their general knowledge of amphibians. Our study shows that all but one conservation measure were well accepted by the public. Importantly, the restrictions people would accept were linked to the attitudes the respondents had towards amphibians and how informed they were regarding the current status of amphibians. Our study highlights the importance of ensuring sufficient education and information for the public and suggests that it is necessary to explore and discuss several conservation options with the public before implementing conservation measures that may not be perceived equally."

Eels were tagged with acoustic transmitters in 3 different river catchments in western europe and swam to the dutch-belgian coastal zone during their spawning migration. Therefore, at least part of the western european population of eels migrates towards the english channel, in contrast with the nordic migration route hypothesis.

We studied springs of three limnological types, along the entire length of the river valley, and identified 42 beetle species. All types of springs were dominated by stagnobiontic species, which enter springs from other aquatic environments, mainly via dispersion by air. We also found a small proportion of crenophiles and a substantial proportion of rheophiles and tyrphophiles, which was linked to the close proximity of the river and dystrophic water bodies. The fauna of the springs was affected to a similar degree by local environmental factors and by landscape factors acting on a broader scale.

Mechanical removal was implemented in 2004, but northern pike population dynamics and removal efficacy were not well understood. We analyzedmark-recapture records from 8,929 individual northern pike captured during 2004-2010 from three reaches of the yampa river: hayden to craig (upstream reach), south beach-little yampa canyon-juniper (middle reach), and maybell-sunbeam (downstream reach), encompassing 175 river kilometers. Annual survival rates for northern pike of the mean tl (465 mm) were highest downstream (mean = 0.54; range = 0.36-0.71) and lowest upstream (mean = 0.25; range = 0.12-0.38). Annual abundance exhibited the opposite pattern, as it was highest upstream (annual range = 1,144-4,078 fish) and lowest downstream (range = 232-746 fish). After removal occurred each year, northern pike abundance increased annually by nearly 1,000% in the upstream reach, over 875% in the middle reach, and over 375% in the downstream reach due to recruitment and immigration. Resulting densities were 4-58 times higher than those for a native apex predator, the endangered colorado pikeminnow ptychocheilus lucius. Northern pike movement was mostly (90%) downstream and sometimes extensive, which may have promoted establishment of additional populations. Removal rates were inadequate to reduce northern pike abundance in the yampa river because recruitment and immigration exceeded removal and mortality. Investigation of reproduction and recruitment, along with source management, spawning disruption, and increased removal, are needed to further reduce northern pike abundance and to aid recovery of native and endangered fishes. These findings underscore the need for sustained, comprehensive, and often costly removal efforts-including evaluation of their effects-in the face of the expanding distribution and abundance of invasive predator species."

The democratic republic of congo (drc) suffered heightened political instability that intensified during its first (1996-1997) and second (1998-2003) civil wars. Ground-based observations reported severe impacts on wildlife from increased human reliance on bushmeat as well as evidence of human populations moving deeper into interior forests to escape conflict. Both were observed in the study area comprised of forests in and around luo scientific reserve located in northern drc, where studies on wild bonobos (pan paniscus) have been conducted since 1973. Using landsat tm and etm + satellite imagery, we employed an automated classification tree algorithm developed specifically for central africa to monitor wartime patterns of human migration and resource use in the study area. We analyzed and compared primary forest loss and degradation rates across two decades (1990-2010). Annual rates of primary forest loss occurring during the 1990-2000 decade were over double the rates of the mainly post-war 2000-2010 decade, indicating higher human pressure on the forests during wartime. Maps and analyses of peripheral forests occurring around the edges of forest clearings illustrated an increased prevalence of small, scattered clearings during the war. We also found evidence showing there was likely less human pressure on interior forests after the wars ended. We demonstrate the utility of satellite-based remote sensing techniques for monitoring human access in interior forests and examining wartime links to observed declines in wildlife.

Proponents of an alternative non-equilibrium paradigm argue that in variable rangeland environments, external climatic events are critical to vegetation dynamics and there is little opportunity for plantherbivore interactions to reach equilibrium. Understanding which paradigm more effectively describes an ecosystem has important consequences for management. In particular, some authors have argued that a focus on reducing stocking rates in non-equilibrium systems may be futile, and management should be opportunistic in response to unpredictable rainfall events. We measured herbaceous biomass and plant species richness and abundance at five 14-year exclosures on innamincka regional reserve. Four were situated in the dunefields land system, and one on the cooper creek floodplain. We did not detect any significant differences between grazed and ungrazed treatments in total species richness or abundance, life form richness or abundance, or herbaceous biomass. Only one species, portulaca oleracea, showed differences in abundance between treatments at more than one site, but the direction of these differences was not consistent. These results suggest that the non-equilibrium paradigm more accurately describes vegetation dynamics in the dunefields and floodplains of north-eastern south australia. It is possible that some species had been lost from the study area prior to the establishment of the exclosures, thereby precluding recovery with protection from grazing; however, a regional analysis of the flora reveals little evidence of this. We argue that the dominance of ephemeral species confers resilience by limiting the development of strong feedbacks between grazing intensity and vegetation dynamics. Current grazing practices seem consistent with the conservation of plant species diversity across the dunefields and floodplains. Future studies should focus on the impacts of cattle grazing on areas of the landscape dominated by palatable perennials, as well as the small number of rare and potentially grazing-sensitive species identified."

However, for recovery to occur, the matrix around the fire must support source populations of immigrants. Therefore, the landscape context of fires may be a critical determinant of the species pool available for (re)colonisation, hence post-fire community composition. Increasingly, fires occur in fragmented systems, and there is limited knowledge of how the surrounding landscape interacts with post-fire community recovery. Aim the present study aimed to examine how landscape context influences faunal communities after large wildfires. Methods three reserves burnt by wildfire were examined 18 months before the study in the mallee region of south-eastern australia. In all cases the burnt area consisted of natural mallee woodland. Two fires occurred within a matrix of extensive natural vegetation, while the third fire burnt >80% of a reserve situated within a highly fragmented, largely agricultural landscape. Birds, reptiles and mammals were surveyed at 90 sites inside and outside the fire boundaries, and relationships of species occurrence to reserve location, burnt versus unburnt status and distance from fire edge were all examined. Key results post-fire faunal communities reflected the species in the surrounding unburnt landscape. Notably, open habitat specialists, invasive species and species that can persist in small habitat patches were prominent within the fragmented system. Post-fire fauna communities were also influenced by variation of the natural vegetation surrounding the fire. The occurrence of species with low dispersal ability (i.e. Reptiles) was influenced by local (patch scale) vegetation structure. 2conclusions the landscape context of fires is a major driver of the composition of post-fire faunal communities. Our results highlight the potential loss of species sensitive to fragmentation from fire-prone natural vegetation within modified landscapes, and that a reduced pool of potential immigrants leads to attenuated succession', compromising recovery of the pre-fire community. Implications post-fire colonists reflect the surrounding landscapes species pool, such that reserves surrounded by fragmented or otherwise low quality habitat are at risk of attenuated succession after fire.

One of the most invasive species in this group is the red swamp crayfish, procambarus clarkii (girard, 1852). In addition to other characteristics facilitating its invasiveness, it is also a vector of crayfish plague, a disease mostly lethal to crayfish of non-north american origin. Procambarus clarkii, at present the most widespread crayfish species globally, is popular in many countries both for human consumption and as an ornamental animal. An established population of this species was documented for the first time within indonesia, representing the first record for maritime southeast asia. The species is also common in the local ornamental pet trade. Infection by the crayfish plague pathogen aphanomyces astaci schikora was confirmed both in the outdoor population of p. Clarkii and in one of the surveyed pet shops. Furthermore, a. Astaci was detected in specimens of freshwater crab and shrimp species coexisting with p. Clarkii. Local climatic conditions and the species temperature requirements suggest a high probability of the establishment of p. Clarkii in indonesia. Its further spread could irreversibly damage populations of many native endemic crustaceans in the country (as well as elsewhere in the region), and the thriving local aquacultures of the redclaw crayfish cherax quadricarinatus (von martens, 1868) may also be threatened. The total ban of p. Clarkii and other crayfish species of north american origin in indonesia is strongly recommended, especially considering that aquaculture and trade with australasian species is a viable alternative option."

Imports emerge as a significant tool to improve fish productivity through biodiversity conservation and induce the use of less capital intensive technology. Conversely, tac system harms biodiversity leading to increased capital effort and reduced catch levels. Another interesting finding is the existence of an environmental kuznets curve (ekc)-type relationship between per capita gross domestic product (gdp) and fish catch. As development proceeds, propensity to import increases, having favourable impact on biodiversity through reduced fish production."

However, mongolia, which constitutes a major portion of the species' distribution, still sustains a relatively large population. Here, we used mitochondrial coi sequences to investigate the within-population genetic diversity and both the genetic and phylogeographic structures of 24 g. Mopsus populations across the species' main distribution in mongolia. Several lines of evidence indicated that the phylogeographic structure of g. Mopsus had been influenced by a recent and sudden demographic expansion. Interestingly, the expansion of mongolia's g. Mopsus population corresponded to the advent of livestock domestication in the region, and the species' genetic structure coincided with road networks, which presumably serve as migration routes for livestock that might mediate the beetle's dispersal. In addition, we also found that g. Mopsus possesses high levels of haplotype diversity, which is generally indicative of large effective population sizes (ne). Overall, the present study contributes to the current understanding of g. Mopsus' demographic history and dispersal patterns and also provides valuable information for the species' conservation and management."

While there is general agreement that this fishery is managed under principles that foster sustainability, the stock is not wholly contained within the us exclusive economic zone. Management of straddling stocks can be highly contentious, particularly when, as is the case for pollock, the spatial distribution varies considerably. When the center of pollock abundance shifts to the northwest, an increased portion of the stock is exposed to harvest by vessels operating in the russian federation exclusive economic zone. The lack of coordination in the management of this transboundary stock presents a risk that is not reflected in current management strategies. We use a multiple product/multiple market bioeconomic model to characterize optimal cooperative and non-cooperative harvest management strategies from the perspective of us and russian pollock fisheries under environmentally induced changes in pollock abundance and the distribution of that abundance."

This region is subject to a growing resort industry, yet the ecological effects of this disturbance remain largely unknown. Using mist-nets, we sampled birds during two early winters and one late winter. We sampled at sites adjacent to coastal resorts, and at a distance of up to 5.7 km from resorts, in three habitat types (mixed mangrove, semi-deciduous, and coastal scrub forests). We tested for differences in abundance and richness at sites near and far from resorts and among the three habitat types. We also assessed whether bird distribution was associated with fruit abundance and/or vegetation characteristics. Across seasons, migrants were consistently more abundant at sites near resorts than at sites more distant, whereas richness of cuban residents was consistently higher at sites near resorts than at those farther away. Neither abundance nor richness of the resident guild varied significantly by habitat. The distributions of neither migrants nor residents were correlated with fruit abundance. High foliage density associated with greater edge habitat provided the strongest explanation for high estimates of abundance and richness of migrants and residents near resorts. Our results suggest that moderately disturbed forests near resorts can support abundant and rich communities of both migrants and residents."

Therefore, how communities generate knowledge and apply it to resource management practices influence the potential for biodiversity conservation of agroforestry systems. In this study, we investigated the use of knowledge by farmers to manage coffee (coffea arabica) agroforests and the consequences for the conservation of tree biodiversity and composition of surrounding forests. We interviewed 50 coffee farmers to investigate their shade tree preferences and sources of knowledge of the properties of shade trees and coffee management practices; we also conducted tree inventories in 31 coffee farms and 10 forest sites in la sepultura biosphere reserve in chiapas, mexico. Our results showed that farmers are modifying agroforests according to their knowledge and tree preferences, and that the resulting agroforest is lower in tree diversity and dominated by pioneer and farmers' preferred tree species as compared to forests. The principal sources of knowledge of management practices are external sources, such as governmental and non-governmental organizations, whereas the primary source of tree specific knowledge is empirical knowledge. We found that the higher proportion of pioneer trees relative to forest is mostly explained by farmers' tree selection decisions (63%) rather than as a byproduct of management practices (37%) that disturb the soil and open the canopy, altering light penetration and microclimate conditions. Based on interviews and tree inventories, we found that farmers gradually replace canopy trees of neutral and disliked species by preferred species, in particular inga spp. We found that external sources continue to promote the idea that inga spp. Trees bring significant benefits to coffee production in spite of a lack of scientific evidence to support this claim. This indicates that farmers are receptive to incorporate outside knowledge into their knowledge systems and adapt their resource management practices accordingly. Our findings highlight the importance of disseminating sound and clear scientific information to practitioners who work directly with farming communities to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information is being contributed to local knowledge systems."

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

A total of 378 species of phytoplankton taxa belonging to 196 genera and 109 families were reported from the hooghly-matla estuarine system which is among the major biodiversity hotspots of the world and plays a pivotal role as nursery ground for fish and shell species. Being an estuarine system its working as a sink for abatement of the pollutants and plays an important role in mitigating flood and other catastrophic changes mediated due to climatic invariability. About 97% of these phytoplankton taxa (365 species) are distributed across four major groups; the diatoms constitute 52% of the phytoplankton diversity with 195 species, followed by the green algae (82 species), blue-green algae (59 species) and dinoflagellates (29 species). Moreover, there are four minor groups that constitute the remaining 3% of phytoplankton taxa with 13 species. Our survey on the phytoplankton communities of the tidal freshwater zone recorded 91 species of phytoplankton, with dominance of green algae (41 species) followed by diatoms (34 species). Our own studies also revealed ecological indicator groups, with diatoms being dominant in open estuarine waters, whereas the estuarine wetlands were mainly inhabited by blue-green algae. A literature review revealed indicator plankton species for issues of global climate change and sea level rise in india and its neighbouring countries. Due to immense ecological variability, a shift in phytoplankton community structure was revealed in available literature. This article illustrates status of phytoplankton communities and their population dynamics along the entire estuarine system, providing a sound base for assessing impact studies and solving transboundary issues between india and adjoining countries."

However, the work required to assess extinction risk is intensive. We demonstrate an alternative approach to monitoring extinction risk, based on the response of species to external conditions. Using retrospective international union for conservation of nature red list assessments, we classify transitions in the extinction risk of 197 mammalian carnivores and ungulates between 1975 and 2013. Species that moved to lower red list categories, or remained least concern, were classified as 'lower risk'; species that stayed in a threatened category, or moved to a higher category of risk, were classified as 'higher risk'. Twenty-four predictor variables were used to predict transitions, including intrinsic traits (species biology) and external conditions (human pressure, distribution state and conservation interventions). The model correctly classified up to 90% of all transitions and revealed complex interactions between variables, such as protected areas (pas) versus human impact. The most important predictors were: past extinction risk, pa extent, geographical range size, body size, taxonomic family and human impact. Our results suggest that monitoring a targeted set of metrics would efficiently identify species facing a higher risk, and could guide the allocation of resources between monitoring species' extinction risk and monitoring external conditions."

We examined the effects of conventional oil and gas development on forest habitat including amounts of core and edge forest, the abundance of songbird species and guilds, species diversity, and community similarity within and between mixed hardwood and oak forest types at both individual wells (local scale) and at the 25-ha scale at differing levels of well density: reference (0wells/site, 0wells/km(2)), low (1-5wells/site, 4-20 wells/km(2)), and high (10-15wells/site, 40-60wells/km(2)). Amount of cleared area, length of roads, and amount of edge increased with increasing well density, whereas amount of core forest declined. At high well densities, 85% of the study site remained forested, but the mean amount of core forest declined from 68% to 2%. Specific changes to forest structure associated with oil and gas development included decreases in basal area and canopy cover within 20m of individual wells and with increasing well density. Of 19 species analyzed, 5 species, including ovenbird (seiurus aurocapilla), blackburnian warbler (setophaga fusca), and black-throated green warbler (setophaga virens), had lower abundance at well sites than reference sites at either the local or 25-ha scale. Six species including american robin (turdus migratorius), chestnut-sided warbler (setophaga pensylvanica), and brown-headed cowbird (molothrus ater) were more abundant at well than reference sites. Eight species did not differ in abundance between well and reference sites. All 3 songbird guilds showed distinct patterns of abundance in relation to habitat differences resulting from oil and gas development that were consistent with known fragmentation effects. Forest interior species were less abundant at well sites than reference sites and showed a declining trend with increasing well density. In contrast, the guilds of early successional species and synanthropic species were more abundant at well sites than reference sites as was species richness (alpha diversity). Avian communities differed between northern hardwood and oak forest types at reference sites but became more similar when wells were present at both scales, suggesting biotic homogenization or a loss of beta diversity occurred as similar species were attracted to well sites in both forest types. The bird communities associated with northern hardwoods and oaks still retained their unique characteristics at low well densities but became similar at high well densities suggesting a threshold somewhere between the low and high well density sites. Consequently, we recommend that if well development is to occur in extensively forested landscapes, conventional oil and gas well development be limited to a maximum of 20wells/km(2) to minimize impacts to forest birds.

Results we find a total of 2,292 records of 136 species of alien reptiles and amphibians. Although species from many regions of the world can be found, most are snakes, lizards and anurans originating in the americas. Although records of alien amphibians and reptiles are found throughout brazil, they are concentrated in more economically developed areas. Socio-economic measures have both a direct and indirect causal relationship over the distribution of alien species and affect all introduction pathways, which are key factors explaining the alien species' distribution. Pet trade was directly related to alien diversity, while all the three introduction pathways contributed to explain the number of records. Main conclusions we reveal a high diversity of alien amphibians and reptiles widespread in an already megadiverse country. The finding that alien richness occurs in highly populated and wealthy areas and that it is linked to the pet trade helps to direct efforts towards the surveillance and prevention of the spread of alien species in brazil. A higher record incidence is associated with species introduced accidentally or for human consumption, mainly represented by a few already invasive widespread species, impairing management measures."

This is particularly concerning in many protected areas because the increase of recreational activities requiring the use of vehicles. Effects of roads and traffic within guild scenarios and ecological processes remain however poorly known. Here we examined how road proximity and traffic intensity influence patterns of resource use in an old-world avian scavenger guild living in a protected natural park in northern spain. We experimentally placed 130 carcasses at different distances from a scenic road in the centre of the park. Vehicleswere recorded bymeans of traffic counterswhich revealed that maximumnumbers were reached during weekends and holidays and during themiddle hours of the day. Avian scavenger attendance at carcasses was recorded by means of camera-traps. Obligated scavengers, eurasian griffon (gyps fulvus) and egyptian vultures (neophron percnopterus) were frequently observed (59.4% and 37.7% of the consumed carcasses) together with five other facultative scavenger species. We found that the richness (number of species) and the probability of consumption of the resource were reduced the smaller the distance to the road and in dayswith higher traffic intensity. The same factors affected the probability of presence of all the scavenger species. Moreover, some of them, notably griffon vultures, showed hourly patterns of carcass attendance suggesting avoidance of maximum traffic levels. Our results highlight that roads and traffic would trigger consequences on the structure and functioning of scavenger food webs, which may be particularly concerning in protected areas with remarkable levels of biodiversity. Future regulations at protected areas should couple both traffic and tourist affluencewithwildlife conservation. In this way important ecological processes would be preserved while maintaining a good dissemination of natural values. (C) 2018 elsevier b.v. All rights reserved."

Bird species may act as carriers in the transmission of enteric pathogens. However, epidemiological studies on zoonotic bacteria in wild birds are rare in brazil. From march 2011 to march 2012, we investigated the frequency of enterobacteriaceae in cloacal swab samples from 109 birds of the passerine and psittacidae families. These birds were recovered from illegal trade in rio de janeiro, brazil, and sent to a rehabilitation center. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 86 wild birds (78.9%). A mean (+/- sd) of 1.68 (+/- 1.30) different bacterial species were isolated per bird, with a maximum of five bacterial species from three bird species. The most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli, followed by enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae and other enteric bacteria. Salmonella ser. Typhimurium was isolated from a temminck's seedeater (sporophila falcirostris), and two salmonella ser. Panama were isolated from two specimens of chestnut-capped blackbird (chrysomus ruficapillus). Of the 70 selected bacterial isolates, 60 exhibited antibiotic resistance. The resistance patterns varied from one to nine of the antibiotics tested. Resistance to ceftiofur was the most prevalent, followed by ampicillin and ceftriaxone. The dissemination potential of resistant strains in situations typically seen in the management of captive birds may become a problem for the conservation of natural bird populations and for public health.

The replacement of natural, often sedimentary, substrata with hard substrata has altered the distribution of species, particularly non-indigenous species, and can facilitate the assisted migration of native species at risk from climate change. This has been likened to urbanization as a driver of global biotic homogenization in the marine environment the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic, or functional similarity of communities at local, regional, and global scales. Ecological engineering research showed that small-scale engineering interventions can have a significant positive effect on the biodiversity associated with artificial structures, promoting more diverse and resilient communities on local scales. This knowledge can be applied to the design of multifunctional structures that provide a range of ecosystem services. In coastal regions, hybrid designs can work with nature to combine hard and soft approaches to coastal defence in a more environmentally sensitive manner. The challenge now is to manage ocean sprawl with the dual goal of supporting human populations and activities, simultaneously strengthening ecosystem resilience using an ecosystem-based approach."

The rate of biodiversity loss due to human activity in the last 50 years has been more rapid than at any other time in human history, and many of the drivers of biodiversity loss are increasing, including habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species, climate change, and pollution, including pollution from reactive nitrogen (nr). Of these stressors, climate change and nr from anthropogenic activities are causing some of the most rapid changes. Climate change is causing warming trends that result in poleward and elevational range shifts of flora and fauna, and changes in phenology, particularly the earlier onset of spring events and migration, and lengthening of the growing season. Nitrogen (n) enrichment can enhance plant growth, but has been shown to favor, fast-growing, sometimes invasive, species over native species adapted to low n conditions. Although there have been only a few controlled studies on climate change and n interactions, inferences can be drawn from various field observations. For example, in arid ecosystems of southern california, elevated n deposition and changing precipitation patterns have promoted the conversion of native shrub communities to communities dominated by annual non-native grasses. Both empirical studies and modeling indicate that n and climate change can interact to drive losses in biodiversity greater than those caused by either stressor alone. Reducing inputs of anthropogenic nr may be an effective mitigation strategy for protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change."

The apulian coastline counts about 820 km and includes a wide variety of natural environments such as torre guaceto, laghi alimini and porto cesareo and areas with high human impact such as mattarelle (enel power station), brindisi harbour and torre mozza with its fish processing industry. The research was carried out only in the subtidal zone but in different kinds of sediments: coarse, medium, fine and very fine sand, sand in posidonia meadows, coarse organogenous debris and mud. Seventeen stations were sampled at three different depths in two seasons: march and september, resulting in 86 samples of which 58 samples contained tardigrades. A total of 4288 specimens (2975 in march and 1313 in september) were identified to 52 species (51 in march and 36 in september). The tardigrade fauna along the apulian coast are very rich, hosting more than 1/3 of all known arthrotardigrade species. The species found in southern italy belong to the arthrotardigrade families neoarctidae (one species), stygarctidae (four species), halechiniscidae (42 species) and batillipedidae (six species). Halechiniscidae is the most abundant family followed by batillipedidae, stygarctidae and neoarctidae. The diversity, density and relative abundance were recorded, and the spatial variation of species diversity was statistically evaluated. Coarse sand which is found mainly at 10 m depth seems to constitute the most favourable environment, which is evident from both species number and shannon index h. Bray-curtis cluster analysis combined with ordination by principal component analysis discriminate the species composition in three evident main clusters: coarse sand, fine sand and mud. Furthermore, the particular environmental factors in areas with sulphur springs, mussel farms as well as high seasonal tourism, seem to have a considerable impact on the species composition of these areas."

Abundance and seasonal migration of gulls (laridae) on the lithuanian baltic sea coast. Acta biol. Univ. Daugavp., 10(2): 147-164.On the basis of long-term visual observations carried out according to e. Kumari's methodology in 1974-2006 at the sea coast of palanga, an analysis of spring migration of nine species of gulls has been done. The main migratory characteristics, seasonal and annual dynamics, phenology and dependence of migration intensity on weather variables are reported. During observations were registered nine species of gulls. The little gull (larus minutus), black - headed gull (larus ridihundus), common gull (larus canus), lesser black - backed gull (larus fuscus), herring gull (larus argentatus) and great black backed gull (larus marinus) were abundant and the kittiwake (rissa tridactyla), yellow - legged gull (larus cachinnans) and glaucous gull (larus hyperboreus) were uncommon. Numbers of black - headed gulls, common gulls, lesser black - backed gulls and great black - backed gulls were on the statistical decrease. On the average, spring migration of the little gull was started on the 12(th) of april and other species of gulls - on the 12 - 17(th) of march. The duration of the common gull migration was the longest (on the average 67 days) and the little gull migrated the most shortly (on the average 29 days). Gulls abundantly migrated from the fifth 5 - day period in march to the third 5 - day period in may. The majority of gulls migrated in the flocks of 1 - 5 individuals. The most of them moved northward at 1 - 20 m altitude during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th hours after sunrise. The intensity of migration was depended on 8 meteorological factors for northward and 6 factors influenced the migration for southward. The paper contains the main information about environmental and anthropogenic factors affecting abundance of gulls breeding in the baltic sea region which is regarded to be among the most polluted marine ecosystems of the world."

What are the internal and external factors driving the changes, and how predictable are they? What were the time scale and effects of the spread of dutch elm disease (ded)? Locationvardsatra, eastern central sweden. Methodsthe survival, growth and recruitment of all trees (12cm girth) were monitored in 1912, 1967, 1988 and 2013 (more often for a part of the forest). Woody species in the field and shrub layers were surveyed in permanent plots in 1976 and 2012. We used transition matrix models to project changes in population sizes and species composition within the century and for 2050. Resultsthe results indicate that the forest was in a successional development during the first period. The species composition had stabilized by 1967, except for an expansion of acer platanoides and the drastic effect of ded that struck the forest around 2000. It took only a decade to kill virtually all large elms in the forest, leading to strong decrease in stem density and basal area. The evidence for effects of ded is still weak, but there has been an increase in saplings, notably of fraxinus, prunus padus, ulmus, and of shoots of corylus avellana. Several species that are abundant in the vicinity and as seeds fail to establish (picea abies, betula spp., quercus robur, populus tremula). Projections for 2050 based on the third period (1988-2013) are probably unrealistic since fraxinus may also disappear because of the recent arrival of ash dieback. Conclusionsslow dynamics in forests that could follow from climate change will locally probably be overruled by unforeseen catastrophes, such as invasions of forest pathogens. These initiate changes with long lag phases that are difficult to quantify. Still, a dense deciduous forest can resist invasion of colonist species and of regionally dominant conifers; the reason being unfavourable conditions for establishment rather than dispersal limitation."

The gharial, gavialis gangeticus (gmelin 1789), a piscivorous reptile of asian river systems, is increasingly threatened by diverse human pressures. 2. Three survey expeditions were launched to monitor gharial populations, notable wildlife, and the activities and attitudes of local people in a 110km stretch of the chambal river in the national chambal reserve (ncs), india. 3. Only 15% of gharial observed in december 2009 were in the upstream 54% of the surveyed river length. This coincides with the highest density of disturbance including water pumps, fishermen, and the highest growth in fishing activity since december 2008. 4. Although fishing is recognized as a significant threat to gharial, no strong relationship was found between numbers of gharial and fishermen. However, numbers of water pumps, indicative of the intensity of agricultural activity, had a negative relationship with gharial numbers. This relationship was strengthened by omitting the upstream (pali to rameshwaram) survey reach, the tourist area of the ncs, which is also potentially affected by upstream reaches. 5. The downstream 46% of surveyed river length in december 2009 supported 85% of gharial (consistent with trends in other surveys), including 91.6% of males and 81.8% of juveniles. This reach is classified as a high population recorded area of high potential conservation importance, also containing better habitat quality and lower human disturbance. 6. A positive relationship was found between gharial numbers and sand habitat features. However, the davar to ghoonsai survey reach had low gharial numbers despite abundant sand features, perhaps due to a substantial length of the ghoonsai sand bank having been converted or agriculture. This may have significant implications for gharial conservation. Copyright (c) 2011 john wiley & sons, ltd."

The creation of off-farm jobs in the tourism sector, construction or manufacturing has been suggested as a potential way to alleviate pressure on tropical forests. Using sa pa district as a case study, we evaluated the coupling of human and forest dynamics. The district was opened for international tourism in 1993, which had a large impact on daily life in sa pa town and its surrounding communities. Analysis of land cover change for the period 1993-2014, using high-resolution satellite images from three timeperiods and an analysis of covariance, detected possible associations between forest cover change and socio-economic, cultural and biophysical variables at the village level. Between 1993 and 2006, sa pa district experienced a net decrease of forest in favour of arable land, while this trend was reversed in the period 2006-2014. However, trends at district level mask substantial heterogeneity at village level. Results show that deforestation is considerably lower in villages that are strongly involved in tourism activities. Marginal agricultural fields with low productivity are also preferentially abandoned. Because of diversification in alternative economic activities, rural households may become less dependent on natural resources and agricultural products for their survival. These results suggest that the creation of off-farm income sources activities can be a driver of shifts in human-environment interactions, as new livelihood strategies can offset the pressure on forested land.

In this paper, we estimated the loss of agricultural areas due to reafforestation in the belluno province (eastern italian alps) and integrated socioeconomic indicators with topographical features to evaluate the drivers of this change. Land use mapping, obtained from photo-interpretation of aerial photographs and technical maps, was used to quantify changes in forest and agricultural areas (crops, meadows and pastures) during the period of 1980-2000. On average, the forest surface expanded by 21%, while the agricultural areas decreased by 40%. This loss increased in areas with steeper slope, which confirms that the areas that would be first abandoned are those that are less productive and more difficult to manage. The reafforestation rate was particularly strong in the north of the province, where the livestock sector experienced a dramatic decline. In light of this situation and using multiple regression models with a large set of socioeconomic and agricultural indicators, we found that the loss of agricultural areas in 69 municipalities was primarily counterbalanced by the maintenance of livestock farming. The loss of steeper agricultural areas was counteracted by traditional extensive systems; however, it was not counteracted by modern intensive systems, which has important implications because steeper areas have higher landscape and biodiversity values. In addition, tourism development had a positive, although smaller, effect on the maintenance of agricultural areas, while industry development had a negative effect. The results of this study suggest that efforts are needed to maintain a territorial network of traditional extensive farms to avoid further landscape deterioration in alpine areas. Likewise, certain choices toward the economic development of local communities might have an impact on land conservation. (C) 2012 elsevier ltd. All rights reserved."

Damaging these natural resources is not only detrimental to the biodiversity of the world, but to the tourism industry itself. Good biodiversity management is good business for tourism companies. Through contributing to the conservation of biodiversity, tourism companies can improve the quality of the service or product provided, enhance their reputation, increase recognition, publicise themselves, save on costs and increase their income. Significantly can contribute towards making tourism sustainable and guaranteeing the livelihoods of people who work within or benefit from the tourism industry now and in the future. The landuse/land cover (lulc) changes in the extent of different land use categories during the period from 1969 to 2010 was carried out. The paper discusses the negative impacts of tourism on phytodiversity which pinpoints the importance for the conservation of grasslands by means of different diversity indices."

Wildlife farming has been proposed to promote sustainable trade, but characterizing markets and understanding consumer behavior remain neglected but essential steps in the design and evaluation of such operations. We used sea turtle trade in the cayman islands, where turtles have been farm raised for human consumption for almost 50 years, as a case study to explore consumer preferences toward wild-sourced (illegal) and farmed (legal) products and potential conservation implications. Combining methods innovatively (including indirect questioning and choice experiments), we conducted a nationwide trade assessment through in-person interviews from september to december 2014. Households were randomly selected using disproportionate stratified sampling, and responses were weighted based on district population size. We approached 597 individuals, of which 37 (6.2%) refused to participate. Although 30% of households had consumed turtle in the previous 12 months, the purchase and consumption of wild products was rare (e.g., 64-742 resident households consumed wild turtle meat [i.e., 0.3-3.5% of households] but represented a large threat to wild turtles in the area due to their reduced populations). Differences among groups of consumers were marked, as identified through choice experiments, and price and source of product played important roles in their decisions. Despite the long-term practice of farming turtles, 13.5% of consumers showed a strong preference for wild products, which demonstrates the limitations of wildlife farming as a single tool for sustainable wildlife trade. By using a combination of indirect questioning, choice experiments, and sales data to investigate demand for wildlife products, we obtained insights about consumer behavior that can be used to develop conservation-demand-focused initiatives. Lack of data from long-term social-ecological assessments hinders the evaluation of and learning from wildlife farming. This information is key to understanding under which conditions different interventions (e.g., bans, wildlife farming, social marketing) are likely to succeed."

To understand the effects of tundra fire and the resultant thermokarst on revegetation, vegetation and related environmental factors were compared between burned and unburned areas of seward peninsula, alaska, using a total of 140 plots, 50 cm x 50 cm each. The area was burned in 2002 and surveyed in 2013. Seven vegetation types were classified by a cluster analysis and were categorized along a fire-severity gradient from none to severe fire intensity. The species richness and diversity were higher in intermediately disturbed plots. Severe fire allowed the immigration of fire-favored species (e.g., epilobium angustifolium, ceratodon purpureus) and decreased or did not change the species diversity, indicating that species replacement occurred within the severely burned site. Although thermokarsts (ground subsidence) broadly occurred on burned sites, due to thawing, the subsidence weakly influenced vegetation patterns. These results suggest that the fire directly altered the species composition at a landscape scale between the burned and unburned sites and it indirectly altered the plant cover and diversity through the differential modification, such as thermokarst, at a small scale within the burned site."

Here, we combine information about species' flight range potential and migratory refuelling requirements to simulate the number of stopovers required and the duration of current migratory journeys for 77 bird species breeding in europe. Using tracking data, we show that our estimates accord with recorded journey times and stopovers for most species. We then combine projections of altered migratory distances under climate change with models of avian flight to predict future migratory journeys. We find that 37% of migratory journeys undertaken by long-distance migrants will necessitate an additional stopover in future. These greater distances and the increased number of stops will substantially increase overall journey durations of many long-distance migratory species, a factor not currently considered in climate impact studies."

Tropical bryophytes, which have been perceived as extremely good dispersers due to biased rates of monoecy and hence spore production, differ strikingly from angiosperms in their similar patterns of species richness among tropical regions. Here, we analyse the patterns of beta diversity of tropical bryophytes to determine whether their high dispersal capacities have balanced patterns of species richness and erased any difference of post-glacial recolonization patterns between tropical regions. The partitioning of beta diversity for 7485 tropical moss species among 164 operational geographical units (ogus) and 3276 liverwort and hornwort species in 154 ogus revealed a slight, but significantly higher beta diversity among than within tropical regions. The nestedness component of beta diversity did not significantly differ between tropical regions. This indicates that, although regional migration rates were sufficient to erase differences of the impact of pleistocene climate changes between tropical regions, the similar bryophyte species richness of tropical regions cannot be interpreted in terms of unrestricted migrations and that oceans act as a barrier to routine dispersal, which is sufficient to shape large-scale floristic patterns.

The way in which movement among populations is affected by environmental conditions is important for predicting the effects of habitat fragmentation, and for defining conservation corridors. One approach has been to map resistance surfaces to characterize how environmental variables affect animal movement, and to use these surfaces to model connectivity. However, current connectivity modelling typically uses information on species location or habitat preference rather than movement, which unfortunately may not capture dispersal limitations. Here we emphasize the importance of implementing dispersal ecology into landscape connectivity, i.e., observing patterns of habitat selection by dispersers during different phases of new areas' colonization to infer habitat connectivity. Disperser animals undertake a complex sequence of movements concatenated over time and strictly dependent on species ecology. Using satellite telemetry, we investigated the movement ecology of 54 young male elk cervus elaphus, which commonly disperse, to design a corridor network across the northern rocky mountains. Winter residency period is often followed by a spring-summer movement phase, when young elk migrate with mothers' groups to summering areas, and by a further dispersal bout performed alone to a novel summer area. After another summer residency phase, dispersers usually undertake a final autumnal movement to reach novel wintering areas. We used resource selection functions to identify winter and summer habitats selected by elk during residency phases. We then extracted movements undertaken during spring to move from winter to summer areas, and during autumn to move from summer to winter areas, and modelled them using step selection functions. We built friction surfaces, merged the different movement phases, and eventually mapped least-cost corridors. We showed an application of this tool by creating a scenario with movement predicted as there were no roads, and mapping highways' segments impeding elk connectivity."

This study aims to determine the importance of vertically migrating species in the neuston of oceanic waters across the atlantic, indian and pacific oceans and to ascertain the influence of environmental variables on their distribution patterns. Neustonic fish assemblages were primarily controlled by light. They were dominated by late-larvae and juveniles of exocoetidae, hemiramphidae and scomberesocidae during the day. At night, the vertical migration of mesopelagic species changed the dominance pattern in favour of myctophidae and scomberesocidae. The neustonic families' distribution was primarily related to sea surface temperatures, whereas environmental variables at deeper layers were related to mesopelagic migrating families. Canonical correspondence analysis showed a low but statistically significant contribution of several environmental variables to myctophid species composition (10%), with minimum oxygen concentrations ranking first in variance explanation followed by maximum fluorescence, sea surface temperature and 400-m temperature. Spatial autocorrelation also explained 17% of the variance, indicating the influence of other factors such as historical, demographic and dispersal constraints. The low number of myctophid species in the north pacific equatorial countercurrent appears to be related to the low oxygen concentrations observed in this province."

We identified 547 local culturally important species (lcis): 369 were threatened by traditional practices (e.g., hunting) and 161 were protected (e.g., totemic species). Most lcis were found in the indomalayan, neotropical, and afrotropical regions and roughly 30% were involved in nature-based tourism, particularly mammals. Very few lcis (<5) were threatened by tourism. Results suggested that tourism can support species conservation and protect traditional practices by providing alternative local sustainable development options."

Lough neagh is one of the most important non-estuarine sites in the british isles for overwintering wildfowl. A change in the waterbird assemblage following the winter of 2000/2001 was driven mainly by a rapid decline in the population of overwintering diving ducks. Sudden and discrete changes in resident as well as migratory waterbirds may suggest an intrinsic cause. 2. We compared the density and biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates, the food of overwintering diving ducks, in 2010 (following the diving duck population decline) with values from a baseline survey conducted in 1997/1998 (before the decline in diving ducks). 3.

These are compounded by changes in land use/land cover, which in turn are driven mainly by economic and population growth, and urbanization. These factors create a feedback loop, which affects ecosystems and particularly ecosystem services, for example plant-insect interactions, and by consequence agricultural productivity. We studied effects of gec at a local level, using a traditional coffee production area in greater nairobi, kenya. We chose coffee, the most valuable agricultural commodity worldwide, as it generates income for 100 million people, mainly in the developing world. Using the coffee berry borer, the most serious biotic threat to global coffee production, we show how environmental changes and different production systems (shaded and sun-grown coffee) can affect the crop. We combined detailed entomological assessments with historic climate records (from 1929-2011), and spatial and demographic data, to assess gec's impact on coffee at a local scale. Additionally, we tested the utility of an adaptation strategy that is simple and easy to implement. Our results show that while interactions between cc and migration/urbanization, with its resultant landscape modifications, create a feedback loop whereby agroecosystems such as coffee are adversely affected, bio-diverse shaded coffee proved far more resilient and productive than coffee grown in monoculture, and was significantly less harmed by its insect pest. Thus, a relatively simple strategy such as shading coffee can tremendously improve resilience of agro-ecosystems, providing small-scale farmers in africa with an easily implemented tool to safeguard their livelihoods in a changing climate."

Location parana river, south-eastern south america. Methods a fish species list of the parana river basin was organized in a subset of species distributions, according to pre- and post-introductions caused by the elimination of the natural barrier and by other mechanisms. Biotic homogenization was verified by the use of jaccard's and bray-curtis's coefficients, whittaker's beta diversity index, non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (nmds) and nonparametric tests. Results for all subsets of species distributions, we observed an increase in the number of non-native species in common related to the introductions. Between 40 and 52% of the species currently present in the upper parana basin dispersed upstream from the lower parana after the construction of itaipu dam, including at least 1 class, 2 orders, 4 families and 16 genera of fish. Jaccard's coefficient between the upper and lower parana river increased by 6-7.5% only considering the itaipu dam influence and 10.5% considering all mechanisms of fish introductions. More than 50% of the increase in similarity was caused by the elimination of the barrier. Our results indicated functional homogenization related to large-bodied siluriformes (catfish). Main conclusions itaipu lake flooded a natural barrier and allowed hydrologic connectivity between the upper and lower parana river, and many fishes of the lower part of the river were able to colonize the upper stretches. The homogenization of the two assemblages between these adjacent aquatic regions was an unpredicted result of hydropower implementation.

Farmers throughout europe have complained of yield losses due to goose grazing. In spring, the svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed goose (anser brachyrhynchus) migrates through specific staging sites in norway, where the geese graze on dairy grasslands and other types of agricultural lands in the early growing season. Despite this, little is known of the impacts of goose grazing on hay biomass and quality in norway. An experiment using exclosures to prevent goose grazing, and plots that were open for grazing, was established in central norway to test the effects of variable grazing intensity on dairy grassland yields. A single spring-grazing event had severe negative impact at the site with the highest grazing intensity, leading to a 25% reduction in forage yield (milk feed units per hectare) as compared to ungrazed areas. The impacts on the sites with lower grazing intensity were more subtle. The overall reduction (across all sites) of biomass yield was 26%. Forage quality, in terms of milk feed units per kg, was not much affected. Grazing increased the proportion and diversity of weeds, as evidenced by a 49% increase of the shannon biodiversity index, and there was a 1.3% decrease in the proportion of herbage biomass of sown species. Hence, we have confirmed farmer reports on yield losses, gaining an increased understanding of the overall farmer costs associated with goose grazing in this northern latitude region."

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

Does forest recovery really lead to better landscape quality?,MARULL JOAN;OTERO IAGO;STEFANESCU CONSTANTI;TELLO ENRIC;MIRALLES MARTA;COLL FRANCESC;PONS MANEL;DIANA GIOVANNA L,2015,"A growing number of studies argue that forest transition should be enhanced by policymakers given its potential benefits, for instance in slowing climate change through carbon sequestration. Yet the effects of forest transition in landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity remain poorly understood. In this paper we explore the relationships between the forest transition and the landscape changes occurred in a mediterranean mountain area. Historical land-use maps were built from cadastral cartography (1854; 1956; 2012). Metrics on land-cover change, landscape structure, and landscape functioning were calculated. Multiyear data on butterfly assemblages from two transects (1994-2012) was used as indicator of land-use change effects on biodiversity. Results show a forest expansion process in former cereal fields, vineyards and pasturelands along with rural out-migration and land abandonment. Such forest transition involved large changes in landscape structure and functioning. As peasant management of integrated agrosilvopastoral systems disappeared, landscape became less diverse. Even if forest area is now larger than in mid-nineteenth century, ecological connectivity among woodland did not substantially improve. Instead, ecological connectivity across open habitats has greatly decreased as cereal fields, vineyards, meadows and pasturelands have almost disappeared. Butterfly assemblages under changing land-uses highlights the importance of agro-forest mosaics not only for these species but for biodiversity at large in the last decades. Our work emphasizes that conservation of landscapes with a long history of human use needs to take into account the role of humans in shaping ecological features and biodiversity. Hence the suitability of forest transitions should be critically examined in relation to context and policy objectives."

Unregulated wildlife trade propels over-exploitation of species, resulting in population declines, and often in combination with other factors may ultimately extirpate species from their natural habitats. Concern about the impacts of trade on biodiversity has largely focused on flagship animal species. Here, we report on the impact of trade on natural populations of the world's most expensive biological resource, a unique caterpillar fungus (ophiocordyceps sinensis). Based on interviews with 203 harvesters and 28 traders, and focus group discussions in dolpa, nepal, we quantify the amount of harvest and trade. After legalization of trade in nepal in 2001, trade volume increased persistently, reaching a peak of 2442.4 kg in 2009 and subsequently declining to 1170.8 kg in 2011. The local market price has increased by up to 2300% over the last 10 years. However, mean annual harvest declined from 260.66 +/- 212.21 pieces per person in 2006 to 125.82 +/- 96.84 pieces per person in 2010. Our analysis of harvesters' perceptions of resource abundance and sustainability shows that virtually all harvesters (95.1%) believe the availability of the caterpillar fungus in the pastures to be declining, and 67% consider current harvesting practices to be unsustainable.

Location the northern part of the stockholm archipelago, baltic sea, sweden. We resurveyed 27 islands ranging from 0.3 to 33 ha in area. Methods we compared current plant survey data, cadastral maps and aerial photographs with records obtained from a survey in 1908, using databases and a digital elevation model to examine changes in plant community dynamics in space and time. We examined the effects of local and landscape structure and land use changes on plant species dynamics by using stepwise regression in relation to eight local and three landscape variables. The eight local variables were area, relative age, shape, soil heterogeneity, bedrock ratio, number of houses, forest cover change, and grazing 100 years ago. The three landscape variables were distance to mainland, distance to closest island with a farm 100 years ago, and structural connectivity. Hanskis connectivity measure was modified to incorporate both connectivity and fragmentation. Results the investigated islands have undergone drastic changes, with increasing forest cover, habitation, and abandonment of grassland management. Although the total species richness increased by 31% and mean island area by 23%, we found no significant increase in species richness per unit area. Local variables explain past species richness (100 years ago), whereas both local and landscape variables explain current species richness, extinctions, immigrations and species turnover. Grazing that occurred 100 years ago still influences species richness, even though grazing management was abandoned several decades ago. The evidence clearly shows an increase in nitrophilous plant species, particularly among immigrant species. Main conclusions this study highlights the importance of including land use history when interpreting current patterns of species richness. Furthermore, local environment and landscape patterns affect important ecological processes such as immigration, extinction and species turnover, and hence should be included when assessing the impact of habitat fragmentation and land use change. We suggest that our modified structural connectivity measure can be applied to other types of landscapes to investigate the effects of fragmentation and habitat loss."

This is particularly urgent for biodiversity hotspots where protected areas are islands within human modified landscapes. We focus on mammals of the iguacu national park - one of the most important parks in the atlantic forest hotspot - to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas in conserving biodiversity. We monitored 300 km(2) with 37 cameras traps during five years to assess if (1) species occupancy declined over time, and (2) if species occupancy/detectability are spatially associated with illegal hunting, proximity to tourism infrastructure and distance from the edge, estimating the proportion of the park where these negative effects are detected. Many species that are rare in most atlantic forest remnants presented high occupancy within the park, and no decline in occupancy was observed over time. However, the distribution of 11 species was spatially associated primarily with the distance from the edge and proximity to tourism infrastructure, resulting in a decline, across half of the park area, from 13 to 23% in occupancy and from 19 to 35% in detectability (values averaged among species). These negative effects should be even stronger on smaller protected areas, which are the majority in highly altered hotspots. Re-establishing and properly managing buffer zones and restricting tourism to localized areas are essential to ensure the effectiveness of protected areas for biodiversity conservation."
391,12,91,Ruishan,not vetted,2048,"Spatiotemporal distribution of large- and medium-sized mammals and humans in the lar protected area, iran",PARCHIZADEH JAMSHID,2017,"Context. One-fifth of mammal species are at risk of extinction in the wild due to overhunting, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. Protected areas are considered an effective method for conserving biological diversity, and can help prevent declines and extinctions of species. Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas in achieving conservation objectives is vital for successful conservation and management. Aims. The aim of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of large-and medium-sized mammals and humans as an aid to evaluate the effectiveness of the lar protected area in northern iran. This area is expected to be a year-round habitat for seven large-and medium-sized mammal species: (1) brown bear (ursus arctos); (2) golden jackal (canis aureus); (3) persian leopard (panthera pardus); (4) eurasian red fox (vulpes vulpes); (5) wild goat (capra aegagrus); (6) alborz red sheep (ovis orientalis); and (7) wild boar (sus scrofa). Methods. A camera-trap survey (2780 camera-trap days) was conducted in the lar protected area, which included mountains, canyons and plains, from june 2013 to august 2014. The spatial and temporal distribution of four categories of humans in the study area was documented: wardens, poachers, tribal people and tourists. Key results. All aforementioned mammals were photographed in the study area. The lar protected area was a seasonally important habitat for the majority of these species, especially from october to december, whereas the presence of tribal people, tourists and wardens was greatest in summer. Poachers were most common in autumn, when wardens and other humans were less common. Poachers preferentially used an area containing canyons, as did wild goats, bears, leopards, foxes and jackals. Conclusions. The seasonality of the distribution of the seven species, which were most common in autumn, suggests that mammals were avoiding humans in summer. An average of 7.6 photographs of poachers for every photograph of a warden was obtained; this implies a potential threat to the conservation of mammals. Implications. These results suggest that the lar protected area functions as a seasonal habitat for many species of mammals, thus highlighting the importance of adjacent protected areas. Temporal separation of wardens from poachers indicates that reallocation of wardens could reduce poaching."

It was recently opened for tourism activities. To estimate the risks incurred by its fauna in this new environmental context, we conducted a 3-year survey of the terrestrial fauna of the cave, focusing on the four steno-endemic species of beetles present. We established five sampling spots in the chamber that were monitored every 3 to 4months during 3years. Our results did not detect any negative impact of the tourism activity on cave biodiversity. Neither the number of observed specimens nor the species richness decreased in the control spots. The huge size of the chamber is assumed to prevent significant microclimatic changes and the presence of very large boulders and cracks is assumed to offer plenty of suitable spaces, which allow invertebrates to escape local disturbance and illumination. In spite of the high vulnerability of cave organisms, disturbance of cave habitats does not necessarily result in biodiversity decrease, if the cave disturbance is limited in duration, intensity, and spatial coverage with respect to the cave size."

Support for transnational conservation efforts may hinge on key issues like the potential outcomes and whether any collaboration aspect is highlighted. We designed an experiment focused on conservation of open land habitats in denmark and the netherlands. We tested how support of danish households depends on framing in a context of possible losses of habitats and on possible contributions from dutch households to the conservation case. We further tested for presence of loss aversion in outcomes and income. We found that the willingness-to-pay (wtp) for gains in open land habitats at home tended to increase when habitat losses were possible. Framing in the context of others, dutch households, contributing consistently affected danes' wtp for increasing protected habitat areas and for avoiding habitat losses. And the less dutch households contributed, the more danish households contributed with the converse also being true. Our results suggest that overall support for habitat conservation for migratory birds may be higher in cases where a risk of habitat losses exists. Results also suggest that support for conservation at home increase when respondents perceive that they share the challenge with other countries."

Due to factors such as small dispersed populations, specific symbiosis with fungi and with pollinators and their desirability for collecting, many orchids are threatened with extinction. Tourism and recreation is increasingly recognised as a global threat for plants, but is it an issue for orchids? When data on orchids from the international union for nature conservation (iucn) red list was reviewed, we found that 149 (40%) of the 442 orchid species with threat data were at risk from tourism and recreation. This included: 98 (22%) species threatened by residential and commercial development for tourism and recreation, 75 (17%) by intentional collecting within protected areas, and 90 (20%) by human intrusions and disturbance from recreational activities. The three threats often co-occurred and hence can be treated as a threat syndrome. The proportion of species threatened varied among locations with 80% of the 65 species in east asia, 32% of 68 species in south and southeast asia and 94% of 16 orchid species in europe threatened by tourism and recreation. Terrestrial orchids and those growing in forests were more likely to be at risk from these threats. With so many species at risk, increased awareness and recognition of these threats combined with improved management to reduce impacts is needed. Gaps and inconsistencies in the iucn red list must also be addressed to obtain a better understanding of the extent of this, and other threats to plants."

Before herds of woolly mammoths roam and flocks of passenger pigeons soar once again, the international community needs to consider what should be done about de-extinct species from a legal and policy perspective. In the context of international environmental law, the precautionary principle counsels that the absence of scientific certainty should not be used as an excuse for failing to prevent environmental harm. No global legal framework exists to protect and regulate de-extinct species, and this article seeks to fill that gap by anticipating how the global legal framework for de-extinction could be structured. The article recommends that the notions underlying the precautionary principle should be applied to de-extinction and that the role of international treaties and other international agreements should be considered to determine how they will or should apply to de-extinct species. The article explains the concepts of extinction and de-extinction, reviews relevant international treaties and agreements, and analyzes how those treaties and agreements might affect de-extinct species as objects of trade, as migratory species, as biodiversity, as genetically modified organisms, and as intellectual property. The article provides suggestions about how the treaties and the international legal framework could be modified to address de-extinct species more directly. Regardless of ongoing moral and ethical debates about de-extinction, the article concludes that the international community must begin to contemplate how de-extinct species will be regulated and protected under existing and prospective international laws and policies."

The capercaillie (tetra urogallus) is an endangered umbrella species of montane forests in central europe. Despite its status, it has largely been overlooked in forest management planning in the carpathian mountains, a biodiversity hotspot within the european union. Previous investigations of timber management effects on capercaillie have shown contradictory results within europe; habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive forest management have been implicated in population declines, while other studies have suggested neutral or positive effects. In romania, recent changes in forest management have shifted from extensive, selective logging to intensive clearcutting; this change provides the opportunity to assess the effects of harvesting on capercaillie numbers across a full range of forest management intensities, thereby addressing discrepancies in the literature. Across the southern and eastern carpathian mountains from 2009-2011, we used spring counts of capercaillie males at leks to evaluate the impact of forest management, other human activities, and habitat at two spatial scales - stand (similar to 2 ha) and landscape (similar to 300 ha). At the landscape level, the proportion of forest clearcuts and intensity of tourism had significant negative effects on the number of capercaillie males in the lek. In contrast, low intensity selective logging had a positive effect at the local stand (lek) level. Large scale (landscape level) forest clear-cutting had a negative effect on the capercaillie population - areas comprised of clearcuts of 30% reduced male lek counts by 76%. The protection of intact mature and old-growth forests, and forest management practices that emulate natural disturbance processes are recommended to support habitat of this critical umbrella species and associated biodiversity.

Multiple countries in the global south have recently transitioned from net forest loss to net forest gain. Understanding and explaining reforestation patterns is necessary to better understand land cover dynamics and create more effective sustainability policies. We show that international migration a key feature of globalization in the 21st century spurs a transition to greater forest cover in nepal. Although some aspects of globalization - agricultural commodity production and trade in particular - have been identified as contributing to deforestation, the effects of international migration are less well understood. Using data from nepal's national census (1.36 million households) and from high-resolution forest cover change, we find that international outmigration is associated with substantial increases in local forest cover, even after controlling for multiple confounding factors. We find that areas with international outmigration levels above the median in 2001 were 44% more likely to experience net reforestation between 2000-2012. This effect of outmigration is mediated by changes in population density and in household agricultural activity. Effects of outmigration are higher in more agriculturally suitable areas, suggesting that migration-driven forest transitions are influenced by agricultural production systems. We provide new empirical evidence of forest transition driven by international migration and a generalizable analytical approach to the study of forest transitions using secondary global and national datasets. Our results suggest that actions to reach global sustainability, biodiversity targets, and reduced emissions can be better designed and targeted by taking into account the effects of international migration on natural resources and ecosystems."

Wildflower harvesting, ethical trade and social upgrading in south africa's western cape",BEK DAVID;BINNS TONY;BLOKKER THIJS;MCEWAN CHERYL;HUGHES ALEX,2017,"This paper evaluates the outcomes from an ambitious wildflower harvesting programme in south africa's western cape, which has sought to achieve positive outcomes in terms of socio-economic development and biodiversity conservation. Indigenous wildflowers, harvested according to conservation principles, are processed into cape flora' bouquets and sold into international and domestic markets. The principal supply chain provides an example of ethical trade due to the explicit environmental and social standards that are required at local sites of production. The incorporation of such standards represents an attempt to engender economic and social upgrading within the value chain. In this sense, the programme is consistent with dominant policy discourses, which suggest that exploiting potentially profitable niches within international trade flows represents a high road' to economic growth and transformation. The paper focuses upon the job creation and social impacts of the programme in the context of efforts to overcome south africa's deeply entrenched socio-economic disparities and high poverty levels. Despite impressive growth in production and exports during the global financial crisis, there have been mixed outcomes in terms of benefits to stakeholders at the upstream end of the supply chain. The paper concludes by considering the extent to which local initiatives operating under the framework of ethical trade possess the potential to facilitate effective social and economic upgrading."

Yet, its ecosystems are threatened by increasing number of elephants and illegal human activities. Renowned as a model of wildlife participatory management, ngr has mainly been studied for its animal wildlife only. The aim of this study was to uncover ecological effects of recent land management on savanna habitats including tourism, and to conclude on more sustainable options, land use/land cover (lulc) changes and vegetation dynamics in ngr were analyzed. This was accomplished with multi-temporal change detection using landsat images of 1984, 2002 and 2013 to map seven representative lulc classification categories, and quantitative indices of landscape metrics. The results showed that the lulc dynamics in ngr from 1984 to 2013 was mainly characterized by an expansion of gallery forest, tree savanna and agricultural area and a reduction of shrub savanna, woodland and bare soils. From 2002 to 2013, fragmentation in all land cover types increased at the landscape level, whereas at the class level, it decreased for woodland. Our findings provided evidence of habitat degradation in ngr, due to extensive agriculture, tourism and growing of elephants' population. According to the original management goals and the purposes of the reserve, both fauna and tourism are to be maintained and sustained in a sustainable way. Adaptation of land use and targeted wildlife management are the main requirements for avoiding further degradation of vegetation and thus of the existence basis of local inhabitants, animals and tourism."

Despite a cultivation and import ban in switzerland,SCHULZE JUERG;FRAUENKNECHT TINA;BRODMANN PETER;BAGUTTI CLAUDIA,2014,"Despite cultivation and seed import bans of genetically modified (gm) oilseed rape (brassica napus l.), feral gm plants were found growing along railway lines and in port areas at four sites in switzerland in 2011 and 2012. All gm plants were identified as glyphosate-resistant gm event gt73 (roundup ready, monsanto). The most affected sites were the rhine port of basel and the st. Johann freight railway station in basel. To assess the distribution and intra-and interspecific outcrossing of gm oilseed rape in more detail, we monitored these two sites in 2013. Leaves and seed pods of feral oilseed rape plants, their possible hybridization partners and putative hybrid plants were sampled in monthly intervals and analysed for the presence of transgenes by real-time pcr. Using flow cytometry, we measured dna contents of cell nuclei to confirm putative hybrids. In total, 2787 plants were sampled. The presence of gt73 oilseed rape could be confirmed at all previously documented sampling locations and was additionally detected at one new sampling location within the rhine port. Furthermore, we found the glufosinate-resistant gm events ms8xrf3, ms8 and rf3 (all traded as invigor, bayer) at five sampling locations in the rhine port. To our knowledge, this is the first time that feral ms8xrf3, ms8 or rf3 plants were detected in europe. Real-time pcr analyses of seeds showed outcrossing of gt73 into two non-gm oilseed rape plants, but no outcrossing of transgenes into related wild species was observed. We found no hybrids between oilseed rape and related species. Gm plants most frequently occurred at unloading sites for ships, indicating that ship cargo traffic is the main entry pathway for gm oilseed rape. In the future, it will be of major interest to determine the source of gm oilseed rape seeds."

Despite speculation that african elephant (loxodonta africana) browsing impacts bird communities, existing data are limited. I sampled the bird communities of the albany thicket biome at 10 sites in the eastern cape, south africa, half with elephants and half without. Songbird community parameters were best predicted by how long elephants had been present, elephant density and the percentage cover of thicket vegetation. The sites where elephants had been present for longer had more bird species and increased songbird density and diversity. However, bird density also increased with increasing thicket vegetation cover and this is a phenomenon unlikely to be compatible with long-term elephant presence. There was an almost equal split between the number of bird species that appeared to be negatively affected by changes in habitat structure (47%) and those which benefited (53%). Smaller birds were generally more abundant as vegetation structural integrity increased and larger birds were more abundant when vegetation structural integrity declined. The browsing of elephants could be viewed as facilitative for songbirds in the short term. However, this effect may not persist in the long term because all elephant populations (notorious tree-fellers) in the eastern cape are found in fenced areas where natural migration is not possible. More broadly, my data provide important insight into how avian communities respond to habitat transformation at the local and regional scales."

This study was carried out in the biosphere reserve of pendjari (brp) and surrounding unprotected areas to assess the efficiency of the reserve to conserve orchids. A total of 90 plots (52 in protected areas; 38 in unprotected areas) were sampled. The recorded data include: orchid species, number of individuals per species, the height and diameter at breast height of host trees. Diversity indices were used to assess the orchid diversity in the protected and unprotected areas. Preferred habitat conditions of orchid species were investigated using constrained correspondence analysis. An independent t-test and two-way analysis of valiance were performed to assess an existing combined effect of vegetation type and the conservation status on the density of orchid spedes. The importance value index (ivi) was used to measure how dominant an orchid species is in a given zone according to the conservation status of the zone. Only three epiphytic orchids (calyptrochilum christyanum, cyrtorchis arcuata and plectrelminthus caudatus) were recorded and all in gallery forest of unprotected areas. Indeed, 67% and 58% of the orchid species were only recorded in unprotected areas and in gallery forest, respectively. There was no significant difference between the density of all recorded orchids in protected and unprotected areas. The conservation status of the studied zone had a significant effect on the densities of nervilia kotschyi and eulophia guineensis (p < 0.0001). The highest ivi of n. Kostchyi was observed in the protected area and of e. Guineensis was in the unprotected area. This first effort to compile a reference list of the orchid species of the brp showed that some orchid species were well represented within the protected area, but all of the epiphytic orchids were recorded from unprotected areas. A representative gap can be assumed to exist for most epiphytic orchids only recorded in the gallery forests of unprotected areas. Our results highlighted the need to redefine protective management strategies for orchid species in the brp. (C) 2018 saab. Published by elsevier b.v. All rights reserved."

Here, we use phylogeographical and demographic analyses of genome-scale radseq data to assess the impact of a large geographical feature, the amazon river, on lineage formation in a venomous pitviper, bothrops atrox. We compared genetic differentiation in samples from four sites near santarem, brazil, that spanned the amazon and represented major habitat types. A species delimitation analysis identified each population as a distinct evolutionary lineage while a species tree analysis with populations as taxa revealed a phylogenetic tree consistent with dispersal across the amazon from north to south. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial dna variation confirmed this pattern and suggest that all lineages originated during the mid- to late pleistocene. Historical demographic analyses support a population model of lineage formation through isolation between lineages with low ongoing migration between large populations and reject a model of differentiation through isolation by distance alone. The results provide a rare example of a phylogeographical pattern demonstrating dispersal over evolutionary timescales across a large tropical river and suggest a role for the amazon river as a driver of in situ divergence both by impeding (but not preventing) gene flow and through parapatric differentiation along an ecological gradient."

Numerous studies have assessed the relationships between attributes of urban green spaces (size, vegetation, isolation, urbanization) and bird species richness, but little is known about how these factors influence community composition. I censused breeding land birds in 93 urban green spaces in oslo, norway, and species were grouped according to ecology (habitat preference, nest site, migration, diet, and red-list status). I analysed how species richness and, in particular, how community composition (relative proportion of different ecological groups) was influenced by size of urban green spaces, presence of native forest, isolation (i.e. Distance from the periphery of the city) and urban zone (i.e. Centre or periphery of city). Species richness increased with size of green spaces and presence of native forest, but did not decrease towards the city centre. Community composition was affected most strongly by presence of native forest, but site size and urbanization affected some ecological groups. Specifically, sensitive ecological groups of birds (in particular forest species, ground-nesters, migratory species, and species with a specialist diet) depended in particular on the presence of native forest in urban green spaces, with additional positive effects of increasing size of urban green spaces and location close to the periphery of the city."

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the roadkills that occurred between 2012 and 2016 in a 34 km segment along the national route no. 12 in the upper parana atlantic forest (argentina). This segment crosses several natural reserves and supports massive touristic flow. The number of road accidents was compared between seasons of the year, type of vegetation and presence of protected areas, using mixed generalized linear models. We mapped the distribution of accidents to identify critical sites. During the 47 months surveyed, we observed 1784 roadkills: 67.5% mammals, 25.2% birds and 7.3% reptiles. The species with the greatest number of recorded accidents was the white-eared opossum (didelphis albiventris), followed by the black-and-white tegu (tupinambis menanae) and the tropical screech owl (megascops chotiba). Only the reptiles showed significant differences in roadkills between seasons. 72.6% of the accidents occurred in areas with presence of native forest. 70.7% of accidents occurred within protected areas. We identified 13 critical kilometers where the application of measures such as the placement of speed reducers and the adequacy of drainage structures of streams as underpasses are proposed. Once the proposed measures have been implemented, their long-term effectiveness should be evaluated."

We studied odonata communities in 47 forest lakes in sw sweden, 13 that are currently being limed, and 8 that have previously been limed. Thirty-one species were recorded, with the highest mean number in untreated lakes, followed by previously treated lakes and currently treated lakes. Species communities differed between untreated and limed lakes, but only few rare species found in the untreated lakes were absent in the treated lakes. Likewise, species known to thrive in acid environments were either rare or showed no preferences. Comparing the number of records of odonate species within a large regional area to the proportion of lakes inhabited in our study, we found that seven of the most commonly observed species occurred less frequently in limed lakes than in the untreated ones, including two of the three most common taxa. Reduced species numbers in limed lakes might be due to conditions on other trophic levels, including fish predation. We argue that odonata should be considered when developing new biological indices of water quality, although the causes of the observed occurrence patterns need to be studied further."

However, the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list has assessed 45% of the world's reptile species and determined that at least 1390 species are threatened by ""biological resource use"". Of these, 355 species are intentionally targeted by collectors, including 194 non-cites-listed species. Herein we review the global reptile pet trade, its impacts, and its contribution to the over-harvesting of species and populations, in light of current international law. Findings are based on an examination of relevant professional observations, online sources, and literature (e.g., applicable policies, taxonomy [reptile database], trade statistics [eurostat], and conservation status [iucn red list]). Case studies are presented from the following countries and regions: australia, central america, china, galapagos islands (ecuador), germany, europe, india, indonesia (kalimantan), islamic republic of iran, japan, madagascar, mexico, new zealand, the philippines, south africa, sri lanka, vietnam, western africa, and western asia. The european union (eu) plays a major role in reptile trade. Between 2004 and 2014 (the period under study), the eu member states officially reported the import of 20,788,747 live reptiles. This review suggests that illegal trade activities involve species regulated under cites, as well as species that are not cites-regulated but nationally protected in their country of origin and often openly offered for sale in the eu. Further, these case studies demonstrate that regulations and enforcement in several countries are inadequate to prevent the overexploitation of species and to halt illegal trade activities.

However, the effectiveness of these strategies can be severely affected by human-mediated dog movement. If immigration is important, then the location of origin of dogs imported by humans will be fundamental to define the spatial scales over which population management and research should apply. In this context, the main objective of our study was to determine the spatial extent of dog demographic processes in rural areas and the proportion of dogs that could be labeled as immigrants at multiple spatial scales. To address our objective we conducted surveys in households located in a rural landscape in southern chile. Interviews allowed us to obtain information on the demographic characteristics of dogs in these rural settings, human influence on dog mortality and births, the localities of origin of dogs living in rural areas, and the spatial extent of human-mediated dog movement. We found that most rural dogs (64.1%) were either urban dogs that had been brought to rural areas (40.0%), or adopted dogs that had been previously abandoned in rural roads (24.1%). Some dogs were brought from areas located as far as similar to 700 km away from the study area. Human-mediated movement of dogs, especially from urban areas, seems to play a fundamental role in the population dynamics of dogs in rural areas. Consequently, local scale efforts to manage dog populations or their diseases are unlikely to succeed if implemented in isolation, simply because dogs can be brought from surrounding urban areas or even distant locations. We suggest that efforts to manage or study dog populations and related diseases should be implemented using a multi-scale approach. (C) 2016 elsevier b.v. All rights reserved."

The associated tree diversity transition implies that only the most useful parts of local tree flora are promoted. Swampland jelutong, dyera polyphylla, has been domesticated in peat areas jambi province, indonesia. We discuss jelutong domestication in two coastal districts, referring to seven steps in a gradual change from products collected from communal natural forests to specific genotypes managed on private farms. Domestication of d. Polyphylla in jambi was in the initial stages three decades ago, when jelutong latex was directly tapped from the trees in its natural habitat of peat swamp forests. Tapping jelutong latex stopped in 2005 following the national regulation taxing forest products. Some farmers then started jelutong cultivation, motivated by the profitability of trading jelutong latex in the past. Our on-farm study showed that jelutong can be planted in various mixed agroforestry systems, with rubber, coffee or oil palm as dominants. Planted jelutong with good farm management showed diameter growth rates of 1.3 to 1.9 cm year(-1). On-farm trials showed that dolomite as soil ameliorant did not affect diameter growth, but had some effect on height. Jelutong planted between young oil palm had the best performance, while jelutong that was underplanted in mature rubber gardens grew slowly. Slow market revival currently constrains further tree domestication of jelutong."

Using a winter 2006 waterbird survey, we examined the relationships among metrics of bird community diversity and abundance and landscape characteristics of 51 wetland sub-lakes derived by an object-based classification of landsat satellite data. Relative importance of predictors and their sets was assessed using information-theoretic model selection and the akaike information criterion. Ordinary least squares regression models were diagnosed and corrected for spatial autocorrelation using spatial autoregressive lag and error models. The strongest and most consistent landscape predictors included normalized difference vegetation index for mudflat (negative effect) and emergent grassland (positive effect), total sub-lake area (positive effect), and proportion of submerged vegetation (negative effect). Significant spatial autocorrelation in linear regression was associated with local clustering of response and predictor variables, and should be further explored for selection of wetland sampling units and management of protected areas. Overall, results corroborate the utility of remote sensing to elucidate potential indicators of waterbird diversity that complement logistically challenging ground observations and offer new hypotheses on factors underlying community distributions."

China used to be one of the major trading countries with significant bird trade with foreign countries; on the other hand, china is a country with unique avian fauna, many important bird areas and critically endangered bird species. What is the role of the country in world wild bird trade? What kind of insights can we extract from trade records for improving future management of wild bird trade in the country? We retrieved and analyzed international trade records of the cites listed bird species of china from 1981 to 2010 from the cites trade database maintained by united nations environment program and world conservation monitoring centre (unep-wcmc). We found that: (1) international trade of live birds in china peaked during the late 1990s, then decreased to the level before the surge of trade in a few years, the trade dynamics of wild birds may be affected by governmental policy and the outbreak of avian influenza during the period. (2) most frequently traded cites appendix listed birds in china were parrots, most of which were exotic species to the country. (3) birds were mainly traded for commercial purpose. Exotic birds in trade were mainly captive-bred while the most chinese birds traded internationally were captured from the wild. Since many bird species in international trade are threatened to extinction, china should take stricter measures on importing of wild-captured birds and should collaborate with the countries of original in the international bird trade to avoid unsustainable harvesting of wild birds. It is urgent for china to carry out population surveys on those domestic bird species once in significant international trade and to make better conservation decisions based on population status of those birds. In addition, more scientific researchers should be encouraged to participate in the wildlife trade management to avoid misreporting trade data or biased analyses of the trade records."

In this study, we analyzed data from 24 river restoration projects in germany dating back 1 to 12 years and 1231 data sets from adjacent river reaches that lie within 0-5, 5-10, and 10-15 km rings centered on the restored sites. We calculated restoration success and recolonization potential of adjacent river reaches based on stream-type-specific subsets of taxa indicative for good or bad habitat quality. On average, the restorations did not improve the benthic invertebrate community quality. However, we show that restoration success depends on the presence of source populations of desired taxa in the surrounding of restored sites. Only where source populations of additional desired taxa existed within a 0-5 km ring around the restored sites were benthic invertebrate assemblages improved by the restoration. Beyond the 5-km rings, this recolonization effect was no longer detected. We present here the first field results to support the debated argument that a lack of source populations in the areas surrounding restored sites may play an important role in the failure to establish desired invertebrate communities by the means of river restorations. In contrast, long-range dispersal of invertebrates seems to play a subordinate role in the recolonization of restored sites. However, because the surroundings of the restored sites were far from good ecological quality, the potential for improvement of restored sites was limited."

We address how mechanisms explaining intercontinental plant invasions by exotics (such as release from enemies) may also apply to climate-warming-induced range-expanding exotics within the same continent. We focus on above-ground and below-ground interactions of plants, enemies and symbionts, on plant defences, and on nutrient cycling. Range-expansion by plants may result in above-ground and below-ground enemy release. This enemy release can be due to the higher dispersal capacity of plants than of natural enemies. Moreover, lower-latitudinal plants can have higher defence levels than plants from temperate regions, making them better defended against herbivory. In a world that contains fewer enemies, exotic plants will experience less selection pressure to maintain high levels of defensive secondary metabolites. Range-expanders potentially affect ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling. These features are quite comparable with what is known of intercontinental invasive exotic plants. However, intracontinental range-expanding plants will have ongoing gene-flow between the newly established populations and the populations in the native range. This is a major difference from intercontinental invasive exotic plants, which become more severely disconnected from their source populations."

Populations of amazon parrots (amazona spp.) Can be found throughout the world, but data on their status, distribution and impact are incomplete. We gathered and reviewed the available information concerning global trade, distribution, abundance and ecology of amazon parrots outside their native range. Our review shows that at least nine species of amazon parrots have established populations outside their original range of occurrence throughout the world (in europe, south africa, the caribbean islands, hawaii, and north and south america). Their elusive behaviour and small population size suggest that the number of alien nuclei could be underestimated or at undetected. Despite international trade bans, the large trade of wild-caught amazon parrots in past decades appears to have contributed to the establishment of alien populations worldwide. Establishment success seems to differ geographically. While european populations are still small and growing slowly, usa populations are large and expanding geographically. This difference is not related to large propagule pressure ( trade) but possibly to a better niche match between native and introduced ranges. Amazona aestiva is the most frequently encountered amazona parrot, with at least eight alien populations reported to date. All these populations, with the exception of those in the usa where the climate is more suitable for their establishment, are composed of a low number of individuals even though they have been established for a long period of time. Further research is required as little information is available on the ecology and potential impact of these alien populations."

WITH A CONTINUING DECLINE IN LOCAL AND GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, IT IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW BIODIVERSITY AND VARIOUS ECOSYSTEM SERVICES INTERACT AND HOW LAND CHANGE MAY MODIFY THESE INTERACTIONS OVER TIME. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO QUANTIFY THESE RELATIONSHIPS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT THE FIRST EMPIRICAL COMPARATIVE RESULTS TO ANALYZE HOW SPATIAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (BES) CHANGED AT MULTIPLE SCALES BETWEEN 1984 AND 2010 IN THE RAPIDLY URBANIZING SAN ANTONIO RIVER BASIN (SARB), TEXAS, USA. WE FOUND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE SPATIAL ASSOCIATIONS AMONG BIODIVERSITY, CARBON STORAGE, AND SEDIMENT RETENTION BOTH IN THE ENTIRE SARB AND THE URBAN WATERSHEDS IN BEXAR COUNTY. OVERALL, BIODIVERSITY AND CARBON STORAGE DECLINED ACROSS THE SARB, WHILE SEDIMENT RETENTION REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE. MOREOVER, THE RATES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND CARBON STORAGE DEGRADATION WERE NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE URBAN EXPANSION AND HAVE ACCELERATED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT (NAFTA) IN 1994. DURING THE PRE- AND POST-NAFTA PERIODS (1984-1995 AND 1995-2010, RESPECTIVELY) THE RATES OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS INCREASED FROM 0.7% TO 0.9%, AND THE RATES OF CARBON-STORAGE LOSS INCREASED FROM 0.1% TO 1.4% PER ANNUM IN THE URBAN WATERSHEDS. OUR HOTSPOT ANALYSES INDICATE THAT THE UPSTREAM WATERSHEDS IN THE BASIN, WHICH SUPPLY WATER TO THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT EDWARDS AQUIFER, SHOULD BE TARGETED FOR PRIORITY CONSERVATION TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF LAND CHANGE ON BES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THE STRONG NEED FOR GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE POLICIES THAT INTEGRATE BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTALLY DELETERIOUS IMPACTS OF THE EXTENSIVE LAND CHANGE UNDER THE NAFTA AND TO ENSURE THE LONG-TERM SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THE RAPIDLY URBANIZING SARB.

In this study, bryophyte diversity affected by different levels of human disturbance in five karst sinkholes was compared. A total of 132 species of bryophytes (17 liverworts and 115 mosses) that belong to 64 genera and 30 families were recorded. The richness of the bryophytes in the natural sinkholes was significantly higher than that of the bryophytes in the sinkholes affected by tourism and used as farmland. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that soil moisture is one of the most important factors that affect the abundance of bryophyte distribution in the five sinkholes. Human activities, including agriculture, animal husbandry, and tourism development, reduce the bryophyte coverage of sinkholes and lead to soil moisture loss. Therefore, effective protection of karst sinkholes is required to maintain their original value for biodiversity conservation."

However, due to ineffective enforcement by governments, many mrs have been reduced to mere ""paper parks"" which fail to achieve conservation goals. This is especially true in countries such as china where compliance is low and resources dedicated to enforcement may be scarce. Privately managed marine reserves (pmmrs) may be effective in areas where government enforcement is lacking. To determine if pmmrs are a viable alternative strategy to protect coral reefs, we surveyed and compared fish assemblages and coral coverage in national mrs in sanya, china to areas of reef privately leased to and managed by dive operators and hospitality industries. We found higher fish abundances and fish sizes in pmmr sites than in mr sites. However, while pmmrs are protected from fishing, other human impacts such as marine debris and illegal coral collection were evident in most tourist sites. Despite protection, long-term monitoring data of pmmrs revealed that in recent years, fish abundances have slightly recovered but species richness has not, indicating the need for a more comprehensive coral reef management plan. We strongly recommend coupling pmmrs with expertise supported regulations as an alternative coral reef management strategy in china."

This study conducted a series of field observation, secondary data analysis and interview at the local and regional levels. Result shows that bromo-tengger-semeru-arjuno has high biodiversity and is the most diverse highland region in east java province. There are a large number of flora-fauna and geological phenomena, reflecting the importance of biodiversity conservation and geotourism development in this area. While there are many positive impacts from tourism, there are also environmental problems. A number of identified problems encompass unsustainable agriculture practices, illegal hunting, illegal logging, forest fire, illegal plant collections and tourism. A large number of visitors at some attraction locations are a critical issue in the biosphere reserve area. The development of other tourist spots has been important to reduce human impact to the biophysical environment of biosphere reserves.

But their impacts on wildlife conservation are poorly understood. In this study we analyze the influence of fifteen years of armed conflict and subsequent peacetime interventions on wildlife populations in manas national park, india. Camera trapping and line-transect surveys were carried out to estimate the densities of carnivores and herbivores respectively. Using relative abundance index, the estimated densities of the three large felids were: tiger, panthera tigris (1.86 animals/100 km(2)), leopard, panthera pardus (1.68 animals/100 km(2)), clouded leopard, neofelis nebulosa (0.58 animals/100 km(2)). Among the ungulates, which are the principal prey species of tigers, wild-buffalo, bubalus arnee was most abundant (22.88 +/- s. E. 11.63 animals/km(2)). The combined density of the ungulate species was 42.02 animals/km(2). Our data and observations from the field indicate that except for the rhino, rhinoceros unicornis, most wildlife species survived the conflict. Relationships between ungulate and tiger abundances indicate that manas can support more tigers than are currently present. The ongoing restoration efforts seem to have an uplifting effect on the overall profile of the park, particularly on tourism and in engaging local communities. Our baseline estimates for the large cats and their prey species will enable future evaluation of the recovery process with respect to change in species abundance over time."

Critical temperature thresholds were observed at 30 and 35 degrees c, the latter representing the most thermally tolerant species in the studied area pararotalia calcariformata, which is the only symbiont-bearing species observed within the core of the heated area.

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

Despite the important role marine predators play in structuring the ecosystems, areas of high diversity where multiple predators congregate remains poorly known on the patagonian shelf. Here, we used biotelemetry and biologging tags to track the movements of six seabird species and three pinniped species breeding at the falkland islands. Using generalized additive models, we then modelled these animals' use of space as functions of dynamic and static environmental indices that described their habitat. Based on these models, we mapped the predicted distribution of animals from both sampled and unsampled colonies and thereby identified areas where multiple species were likely to overlap at sea. Maximum foraging trip distance ranged from 79 to 1,325 km. However, most of the 1,891 foraging trips by 686 animals were restricted to the patagonian shelf and shelf slope, which highlighted a preference for these habitats. Of the seven candidate explanatory covariates used to predict distribution, distance from the colony was retained in models for all species and negatively affected the probability of occurrence. Predicted overlap among species was highest on the patagonian shelf around the falkland islands and the burdwood bank. The predicted area of overlap is consistent with areas that are also important habitat for marine predators migrating from distant breeding locations. Our findings provide comprehensive multi-species predictions for some of the largest marine predator populations on the patagonian shelf, which will contribute to future marine spatial planning initiatives. Crucially, our findings highlight that spatially explicit conservation measures are likely to benefit multiple species, while threats are likely to impact multiple species."

Despite the potentially serious and irreversible ecological impacts caused by non-native species, they continue to be in many cases the preferred option in aquaculture farms, of which the recent plans of aquaculture expansion promoted by the brazilian government are an emblematic example. In this study, we present a survey of publicly available information on aquaculture parks to be installed across the brazilian territory, with emphasis on species status as native or non-native, and discuss the implications for the conservation of aquatic biodiversity. One hundred and thirty-nine aquaculture parks (aps), with a total of 1556 sites covering 941.38 hectares, have been called for bids. Among these, 122 aps will contain at least one non-native species, and 68 aps will be based exclusively on their cultivation. A predictable consequence is the enhancement of propagule pressure in surrounding aquatic ecosystems, increasing the risk of non-native species establishment or persistence, which will likely intensify the environmental impacts already in course in four major river basins and along the brazilian coast. These impacts will add up to more direct effects of aquaculture farming - for example elevated input of nutrients and organic matter - and include changes in habitat and water quality, spread of diseases, biotic homogenization, loss of population viability resulting from hybridization and outbreeding depression, and the local extirpation of native species."

These infrastructures extend well outside metropolitan boundaries and impact distal river ecosystems. We used a comprehensive model to quantify the roles of anthropogenic stressors on hydrologic alteration and biodiversity in us streams and isolate the impacts stemming from hard infrastructure developments in cities. Across the contiguous united states, cities' hard infrastructures have significantly altered at least 7% of streams, which influence habitats for over 60% of north america's fish, mussel, and crayfish species. Additionally, city infrastructures have contributed to local extinctions in 260 species and currently influence 970 indigenous species, 27% of which are in jeopardy. We find that ecosystem impacts do not scale with city size but are instead proportionate to infrastructure decisions. For example, atlanta's impacts by hard infrastructures extend across four major river basins, 12,500 stream km, and contribute to 100 local extinctions of aquatic species. In contrast, las vegas, a similar size city, impacts <1,000 stream km, leading to only seven local extinctions. So, cities have local policy choices that can reduce future impacts to regional aquatic ecosystems as they grow. By coordinating policy and communication between hard infrastructure sectors, local city governments and utilities can directly improve environmental quality in a significant fraction of the nation's streams reaching far beyond their city boundaries."

Those variables negatively influencing the mammal community were reported in one of the study sites. Data indicate both an opportunity for applied integral conservation actions that involve people and their activities, as well as an opportunity to support biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes by integrating human activities with protected areas and conservation.

Currently, 44 monitor lizard species (i.e., 60% of the known global varanid diversity) are recognized from this vast study region. New guinea and the surrounding offshore islands harbor the highest diversity in terms of species (15) and subgenera (four). We provide a detailed identification key to all monitor lizards found in the study area. Moreover, we critically review the conservation status of all monitor lizard species involved as needed in light of urgent conservation issues. Major threats to monitor lizards include: (1) habitat destruction; (2) the international trade in reptile skins and in monitors as pets; and (3) human consumption. Current export figures of seven focal monitor species (i.e., varanus beccarii, v. Boehmei, v. Macraei, v. Melinus, v. Prasinus, v. Salvator, and v. Yuwonoi) of the commercial skin and pet trade reflect export allowances that are not based on sound information from population studies, meaning that current harvest levels may be unsustainable and could threaten the viability of these indonesian island endemics. Therefore, these monitor lizard species require special attention by the relevant authorities and conservationists of both the source and the consuming countries. The conservation status of all monitor lizard species and their assessment in the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list is in need of a critical update and we strongly recommend the establishment of an iucn species survival commission (ssc) monitor specialist group. Therefore, this review of distribution, threats, and conservation status of southeast asian and indo-australian monitor lizards is intended to support customs officers and other government agents in: (1) more strictly enforcing the regulations of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites); (2) monitoring trade activities, annual harvest levels, and export quotas; (3) in reducing current unsustainable harvest levels; and, (4) in reducing over-exploitation and extinction risks of varanus spp. In the wild."

These protected areas are contiguous and are located in the extreme north-central state of mato grosso, in areas considered priorities for conservation due to the high biodiversity and endemism and the high human pressure. Thus, this study focused to evaluate and compare the structure of populations of medium and large mammals in terms of richness and abundance in environments without tourism and with ecotourism activities in cristalino region. Therefore, in the period from may 2008 to february 2010, primary forest environments with two levels of anthropogenic disturbance were sampled: no tourism at all and ecotourism activities. Data were collected by using the distance samplings in linear transect, totalizing 468,3 kilometers traveled during daytime and nighttime, and the record of footprints in previously prepared plots (n = 660 surveyed plots), in addition to river corridors in cristalino river and random searches in places with difficult access due to the lack of roads. Records of 37 species of mammals were obtained, which 33 were medium and large size and four small ones. There was no statistically significant difference in species richness of the environments without tourism and with ecotourism, and the similarity of species among them was quite high (88%). However, three taxa were less abundant in environments with tourism: dasyprocta leporina (linnaeus, 1766), mazama spp. And dasypus kappleri krauss, 1862. Therefore, it can be observed that the negative impact of ecotourism activities developed in the study area presented a small magnitude, in terms of richness and abundance of medium and large mammals. Thus, ecotourism ventures are presented as important economic activity to be developed in areas with touristic potential in the amazon."

Regulated catchments are often subjected to additional stressors, arising inter alia from agriculture, forestry and industry, which are likely to interact with impacts of river regulation on fish and other biota. Such interactions are poorly understood, hindering planning of effective mitigation and restoration. We investigated fish responses to increased discharge (as a restoration measure) in regulated rivers in sweden. We compiled electrofishing data from river channels downstream of hydropower dams, each of which either has or lacks a mandated minimum discharge corresponding to c. 5% of pre-regulation discharge. We further analysed interactions between flow restoration and co-occurring local and regional stressors. River channels without a mandated minimum discharge were characterized by a low diversity of fish species with traits favouring persistence under unpredictable environmental conditions, including omnivory, short life cycles and small size. Additional stressors further reduced diversity and increased dominance by broad-niched, opportunistic species. Both the presence and magnitude of a mandated minimum discharge were positively related to fish diversity and density, and the relative density of three economically and recreationally valuable species. However, the size of these relationships frequently varied with the presence of additional stressors. Increasing levels of hydrological degradation and reduced connectivity at the catchment scale reduced positive flow-ecology relationships and hindered the restoration of fish communities towards reference conditions. However, application of a mandated minimum discharge also assisted in mitigating impacts of some co-occurring stressors, especially reduced riparian integrity. Synthesis and applications. Additional stressors can strongly influence the outcomes of flow restoration for fish community diversity and composition. Our approach combining fish species and trait data from multiple flow restoration projects with information on additional stressors yielded valuable insights into factors affecting flow restoration success, useful for (a) identifying the systems most likely to benefit from mandated minimum flows, (b) modelling influences of multiple stressors on flow-ecology relationships, (c) prioritizing additional measures to manage co-occurring stressors and enhance outcomes from flow restoration."

Community diversity may prevent, enhance or alter how species adapt to changing conditions by influencing population sizes, genetic diversity and/or the fitness landscape experienced by focal species. We tested the impact of community diversity on adaptation by performing a reciprocal transplant experiment on grasses that evolved for 14 years under ambient and elevated co2, in communities of low or high species richness. Using biomass as a fitness proxy, we find evidence for local adaptation to elevated co2, but only for plants assayed in a community of similar diversity to the one experienced during the period of selection. Our results indicate that the biological community shapes the very nature of the fitness landscape within which species evolve in response to elevated co2."

We assessed the influence of limnological zones on the ichthyofauna of three large neotropical reservoirs in two different river basins. We sampled fish through use of gill nets set at 40 systematically selected sites on each reservoir. We used satellite images, algae, and suspended solids concentrations to classify those sites as lacustrine or riverine. We observed significant differences in assemblage composition between riverine and lacustrine zones of each reservoir. We tested if the same zone (lacustrine or riverine) showed the same patterns in different reservoirs. In sao simao, the riverine zone produced greater abundances of native species, long-distance migratory species, diversity, and richness, whereas the lacustrine zone supported greater total and nonnative species abundances. Conversely, in tres marias, the riverine zone supported greater total and non-native species abundances, whereas the others traits evaluated did not differ significantly between zones. Only lacustrine sites occurred in volta grande reservoir. The same zones in the three reservoirs usually had significantly different patterns in the traits evaluated. The differences in spatial patterns observed between reservoirs could be explained partly by the differing morphologies (complex versus simple), the differential influence on tributaries of each reservoir and basin positions (presence or absence of upstream dams) of the reservoirs."

The forested states of west africa have experienced much recent human conflict but there have been no assessments of impacts on the wildlife. We conducted surveys of mammals in the 710-km(2) gola forest reserves to assess the impact of the 1991-2001 civil war in sierra leone. Gola is the most important remaining tract of lowland forest in the country and a key site for the conservation of the highly threatened forests of the upper guinea region. We found that gola has survived well despite being in the heart of the area occupied by the rebels. We recorded 44 species of larger mammal, including 18 threatened, nearthreatened and endemic species, accounting for all species recorded in pre-war surveys and adding several more (african buffalo syncerus caffer nanus and water chevrotain hyemoschus aquaticus). Populations of primates were healthy with little evidence of decline. Duiker detection rates were low and further work is required to confirm their numbers as they include five species endemic (or near endemic) to the upper guinea region, three of which are threatened. However, the population of african forest elephants loxodonta cyclotis has collapsed, with only a few individuals remaining from c. 110 in the mid 1980s. We conclude that peacetime pressures from the bushmeat trade, clearance for agriculture, logging and mining are likely to be far greater for gola than the pressures from the civil war."

Nevertheless, many organisms threatened by human impacts also find shelter in unexpected or informally protected places. For coral reef organisms, refuges can be tourist resorts implementing local environment-friendly bottom-up management strategies. We used the coral reef ecosystem as a model to test whether such practices have positive effects on the biodiversity associated with de facto protected areas. Locationnorth ari atoll, maldives. Methodswe modelled the effects of the environment and three human management regimes (tourist resorts, uninhabited and local community islands) on the abundance and diversity of echinoderms and commercially important fish species, the per cent cover of reef benthic organisms (corals, calcareous coralline algae, turf and macroalgae) and the proportion of coral disease. We used multivariate techniques to assess the differences between reef components among the management regimes. Resultsreefs varied between the management regimes. A positive resort effect was found on sessile benthic organisms, with good coral cover and significantly less algae at resort islands. Corals were larger and had fewer diseases in uninhabited islands. Minor resort effect was detected on motile species represented by commercial fish and echinoderms. Main conclusionsin countries where natural biodiversity strongly sustains the tourist sector and where local populations rely on natural resources, a balance between tourism development, local extraction practices and biodiversity conservation is necessary. The presence of eco-friendly managed resorts, which practices would need to be certified on the long term, is beneficial to protect certain organisms. House reefs around resorts could therefore provide areas adding to existing marine protected areas, while marine protection efforts in local community islands should focus on improving fishing management."

Post-nafta restructuring programs sought to correct previous inefficiencies in this sector, but they have also had the effect of marginalizing the producers who steward and manage the country's reserve of maize (zea mays) genetic diversity. Framed by research suggesting that certain maize varieties in a rain-fed farming region in southern sonora are in danger of loss due chiefly to long-term drought, this article explores the ramifications of post-nafta agricultural policies for in situ maize diversity conservation. Qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews with agricultural support institutions and participant observation with farmers, were used to gather data on dryland farmers' access to research and extension, as well as possibilities for collective action. In southern sonora, agricultural support is oriented primarily toward high-tech production, and there are structural barriers to small-scale farmers' access to research and extension institutions. Further, collective action around agriculture is limited. These circumstances represent significant limitations to farmers' options for accessing new techniques which might help maintain maize diversity in the context of economic and environmental change."

We studied tropical rainforest fragments and derived rubber plantations at a network of sites in xishuangbanna, china, hypothesizing a major decrease in diversity with conversion to plantations. We used metabarcoding of the 18s rrna gene and recovered 2313 otus, with a total of 449 otus shared between the two land-use types. The most abundant phyla detected were annelida (66.4% reads) followed by arthropods (15.5% reads) and nematodes (8.9% reads). Of these, only annelids were significantly more abundant in rubber plantation. Taken together, alpha- and beta-diversity were significantly higher in forest than rubber plantation. Soil ph and spatial distance explained a significant portion of the variability in phylogenetic community structure for both land-use types.

The abundance (catch per unit effort, cpue), species richness, evenness and structure of communities, all within reproductive guilds, were used to test the hypothesis that these metrics vary spatially and temporally. The influence of damming on species structure and the diversity of fish reproductive guilds varied spatiotemporally, and species with opportunistic reproductive strategies tended to be less affected. Conversely, long-distance migratory species responded more markedly to spatiotemporal variations, indicating that the ecosystem dynamics exert greater effects on populations of these species. Thus, the effects of a dam, even if attenuated, may extend over several years, especially downstream.

Here, we use a large dataset on helminth species richness of charadriiform birds to test whether higher habitat diversity and seasonal migration increase parasite richness in avian hosts. Locationglobal. Methodswe compiled a global dataset on helminth species richness, habitat use strategies (marine/freshwater/mixed wintering and osmotic generalist/specialist) and various ecological/life-history traits (migration distance, geographical range size, diet, body mass, sampling latitude) of charadriiform birds. To test if hosts with different habitat use strategies encounter different parasite pressures, we used comparative methods that correct for shared ancestry and phylogenetic uncertainty. Resultshabitat generalists (mixed wintering habitats and osmotic generalists) harboured more parasite species than habitat specialists; marine- and freshwater-restricted hosts had similar helminth species richness. Contrary to previous results, we found no association between parasite species richness and migration distance. Overall helminth species richness also increased with diet diversity, with no effects of other ecological/life-history traits. Main conclusionswe suggest that birds exploiting diverse habitats and diets are exposed to a more diverse parasite fauna and conclude that distribution patterns and habitat use, rather than migration distance, shape parasite diversity within host populations. Overall, these results demonstrate the significant role of habitat use in explaining how migration may indirectly affect parasite richness in host populations."

Spiders, for example, have been shown to respond negatively (some orb weaving species) and positively (ground dwelling species) to urbanization. The effects of urbanization on crab spiders (thomisidae) (sit-and-wait predators that generally ambush their prey on flowers and leaves) are not sufficiently known. This paper describes the thomisidae community that inhabits green patches in a temperate neotropical city, cordoba, argentina, and its surroundings, and ascertains whether there are differences in species richness, abundance and composition between urban and exurban sites. Samples were collected from 30 sites during the summer and spring of 2013 and 2014, using the garden-vacuum method. We compared the abundance, richness and composition of thomisidae among three habitat categories (urban, suburban and external). Seven species in three genera, misumenops, wechselia and tmarus, were detected. Misumenops was the most abundant genus in cordoba, and tmarus elongates mello-leitao, 1929 was collected in argentina for the first time. The abundance, richness and composition of thomisid spiders did not differ between habitat categories, indicating that urbanization does not have a negative effect on the communities of these spiders in open green spaces. Site variability, on the other hand, does, suggesting that local factors may be more relevant than broad-scale factors to explain community patterns in this family."

Urbanization is responsible for some of the most extreme human-altered habitats and is a known driver of evolutionary change, but evidence and understanding of these processes is limited. Here, we investigate the potential underlying mechanisms contributing to the contemporary evolution of migration behaviour in the eurasian blackcap (sylvia atricapilla). Blackcaps from central europe have been wintering in urban areas of britain with increasing frequency over the past 60years, rather than migrating south to the mediterranean. It has been hypothesized that the popularization of providing supplementary foods for wild birds within britain may have influenced this marked migratory change, but quantifying the selective forces shaping evolutionary changes remains challenging. Using a long-term national scale data set, we examine both the spatial distribution and interannual variation in blackcap wintering behaviour in britain in relation to supplementary food availability and local climate. Over a 12-year period, we show that blackcaps are becoming increasingly associated with the provision of supplementary foods in british gardens, and that the reliability of bird food supplies is influencing their winter distribution at a national scale. In addition, local climatic temperatures and broader scale weather variation are also important determinants of blackcap wintering patterns once they arrive in britain. Based on our findings, we conclude that a synergistic effect of increased availability of feeding resources, in the form of garden bird food, coupled with climatic amelioration, has enabled a successful new wintering population to become established in britain. As global biodiversity is threatened by human-induced environmental change, this study presents new and timely evidence of the role human activities can play in shaping evolutionary trajectories."

As research on the topic expands at an exponential rate, a comprehensive understanding of the variability in organisms' responses and corresponding levels of certainty is necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing the results of 228 studies examining biological responses to ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups, suggesting there is some predictable trait-based variation in sensitivity, despite the investigation of approximately 100 new species in recent research. The results also reveal an enhanced sensitivity of mollusk larvae, but suggest that an enhanced sensitivity of early life history stages is not universal across all taxonomic groups. In addition, the variability in species' responses is enhanced when they are exposed to acidification in multi-species assemblages, suggesting that it is important to consider indirect effects and exercise caution when forecasting abundance patterns from single-species laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the results suggest that other factors, such as nutritional status or source population, could cause substantial variation in organisms' responses. Last, the results highlight a trend towards enhanced sensitivity to acidification when taxa are concurrently exposed to elevated seawater temperature."

Size measures of fossil bosmina mucros, carapaces, and antennules provided inferences of predation intensity. We observed two notable shifts of predation over the span of our similar to 500 year record. First, in the late-1800s, a considerable reduction in bosmina mucro length (an indication of reduced invertebrate predation) occurred following centuries of stable, but high invertebrate predation intensity. Nearly concurrent with reduced invertebrate predation was a substantial decline in sedimentary-inferred chlorophyll a (a measure of primary production). We hypothesise that turn-of-the century climate warming resulted in a shift in the dominant lake stratification regime at our study site, thus impacting both invertebrate predation intensity and overall primary production. Second, following an observed minnow introduction in the 1980s, the chaoborus assemblage experienced a minor shift from larger-to smaller-bodied species, and total chaoborid concentrations were generally the lowest and most stable of the record. C. Americanus was not extirpated from the lake, despite large growth in the minnow population. Although c. Americanus is a reliable indicator of fishless conditions when obligate planktivorous fish are considered, our data suggest that absolute fishless conditions may be difficult to establish with confidence using the presence of c. Americanus mandibles alone, as this taxon can co-exist with minnow species that are not solely planktivorous. Our palaeolimnological investigation provides temporal insight on predator-prey interactions occurring in small, shallow headwater lakes that have experienced historic shifts in predation due to long-term environmental change as well as a contemporary fish introduction."

Pyrosequencing of small subunit ribosomal rna gene hypervariable regions to characterize microbial communities along a hydrological continuum in arctic tundra showed a pattern of decreasing diversity downslope, with highest species richness in soil waters and headwater streams, and lowest richness in lake water. In a downstream lake, 58% and 43% of the bacterial and archaeal taxa, respectively, were also detected in diverse upslope communities, including most of the numerically dominant lake taxa. In contrast, only 18% of microbial eukaryotic taxa in the lake were detected upslope. We suggest that patterns of diversity in surface waters are structured by initial inoculation from microbial reservoirs in soils followed by a species-sorting process during downslope dispersal of both common and rare microbial taxa. Our results suggest that, unlike for metazoans, a substantial portion of bacterial and archaeal diversity in surface freshwaters may originate in complex soil environments.

Current pas may, however, continue to be important if they provide suitable locations for species to colonize at their leading-edge range boundaries, thereby enabling spread into new regions. Here, we present an empirical assessment of the role of pas as targets for colonization during recent range expansions. Records from intensive surveys revealed that seven bird and butterfly species have colonized pas 4.2 (median) times more frequently than expected from the availability of pas in the landscapes colonized. Records of an additional 256 invertebrate species with less-intensive surveys supported these findings and showed that 98% of species are disproportionately associated with pas in newly colonized parts of their ranges. Although colonizing species favor pas in general, species vary greatly in their reliance on pas, reflecting differences in the dependence of individual species on particular habitats and other conditions that are available only in pas. These findings highlight the importance of current pas for facilitating range expansions and show that a small subset of the landscape receives a high proportion of colonizations by range-expanding species."

However, declining regional biodiversity can undermine efforts to maintain, expand and link wildlife populations. Narratives promoting species connectivity should thus be founded on studies of system and state changes in key resources. By integrating and augmenting multiple data sources throughout eight wildlife management areas, covering 1.7 million ha, we report changes during 1978-2015 in the occurrence and distribution of 31 mammal species throughout a landscape linking the greater kafue system to adjacent wildlife management areas in namibia and botswana. Results indicate species diversity is largely unchanged in kafue national park and mulobezi and sichifulo game management areas. However, 100% of large carnivore and 64% of prey diversity have been lost in the simalaha areas, and there is no evidence of migrational behaviour or species recolonization from adjacent wildlife areas. Although temporal sampling scales influence the definition of species occupancy and distribution, and data cannot elucidate population size or trends, our findings indicate an emerging connectivity bottleneck within simalaha. Evidence suggests that at current disturbance levels the greater kafue system, zambia's majority component in the kavango-zambezi transfrontier conservation area, is becoming increasingly isolated at the trophic scale of large mammals. Further investigations of the site-specific, interacting drivers influencing wildlife distribution and occurrence are required to inform appropriate conservation interventions for wildlife recovery in key areas identified to promote transboundary connectivity in the kavango-zambezi transfrontier conservation area."

But, the ongoing ornamental fish trade and introduction of exotic fishes in the wild pose a serious threat to india's native aquatic diversity. Recent studies from several parts of india have revealed the presence of several ornamental fishes in inland water bodies, including the biologically sensitive areas such as chalakudy river in the western ghats, a biodiversity hotspot which harbours 16 endangered and 4 critically endangered species. So far, 27 ornamental species have been reported in the inland wetlands of india. Among them, 15 have already established a good breeding population and have emerged as a threat to the native species. Awareness among the public, policy makers and researchers about the impacts of ornamental fishes in inland water is the need of the hour. Stringent measures should be taken to monitor the aquarium fish trade and accidental release of exotic species into inland waters. If not, the invasion of ornamental fishes may demolish the inland aquatic diversity of native indian breeds."

In this study we aimed to assess the environmental impact of ecotourism on the fish fauna of sucuri river in bonito by integrating ecological, behaviour and physiological criteria and using the fish species crenicichla lepidota and moenkhausia bonita as indicators. Two distinct sites were defined to collect data: (1) affected daily by ecotourism (tourism) and (2) undisturbed (no tourism). The ""stationary point count"" method was performed to assess variations in ecological parameters and ""ad libitum"" and focal animal methods were used to collect behaviour data. The cortisol response of m. Bonita to a stress protocol was measured from holding-water. Results showed a significantly increase in species richness, density and diversity at the tourism site. Nevertheless, behaviour patterns indicated a higher stress at the tourism site for both species as well higher cortisol levels for m. Bonita. In opposition to the ecological measures, the behaviour and physiological ones may be interpreted as an early sign of negative impact caused by ecotourism, prior to changes at community level."

We monitored site use by waterbirds at lake chapala, the largest lake in mexico and recently designated ramsar site, to evaluate the potential influence of water hyacinth cover on species composition and aggregate measures of the waterbird community, including waterbird density, species richness, and simpson's index of diversity. We examined the response of waterbirds to changes in percent water hyacinth cover at 22 independent sites around the lake during six study seasons from may 2006 to february 2008. We found little evidence to suggest that percent water hyacinth cover affected aggregate community measures; however, multivariate analysis of relative species composition suggested that water hyacinth cover corresponded with seasonal species composition (canonical correspondence r = 0.66, p = 0.007) when seasonal site cover averaged 17.7 +/- 4.67% (winter 2007). Several migratory species were not observed during this season, which could suggest that some small-bodied migratory species avoided lake chapala during the winter of high water hyacinth cover. We suspect that observed changes in the waterbird community are in response to species-specific tolerances for water hyacinth and indirect abiotic and biotic effects of its presence (e.g., invertebrate and fish composition)."

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

A variety of factors associated with industrial development may impact nesting birds in this region, including increased nest predator populations associated with anthropogenic nesting and perching sites and the availability of anthropogenic food sources. We tested the indirect impact of oil development on nest survivorship in an artificial nest experiment at prudhoe bay, alaska, 2012-2014, by establishing and monitoring 268 artificial shorebird nests and 221 artificial waterfowl nests and through monitoring of real shorebird nests (n = 186). Distance to infrastructure and roads, and area of infrastructure within 2 km(2) of the nest did not significantly affect nest survival of artificial or real nests. Artificial nest survival was higher at shorebird than waterfowl nests. Cameras deployed at a subset of artificial shorebird nests documented nest predation by arctic fox (alopex lagopus), red fox (vulpes vulpes), parasitic jaegers (stercorarius parasiticus), pomarine jaegers (stercorarius pomarinus), long-tailed jaegers (stercorarius longicaudus), northern harriers (circus cyaneus), and glaucous gulls (larus hyperboreus). The presence of a camera had a positive effect on artificial shorebird nest survival, possibly due to cameras being placed on progressively older nests throughout the season. In conclusion, we did not detect an effect from infrastructure on nest survival at the scale of the study, in either real or artificial nests. We suggest caution when using artificial nests for arctic research, given differences in survival of real and artificial nests in this study, and potential differences in nest predators."

What shifts in plant traits occur along gradients of tourism intensity? What recommendations regarding the sustainable management of baltic sea beaches can be proposed? Location: southern baltic sea beaches in germany. Methods: in this study, the species composition of vascular plants on beaches with differing accessibility to tourists was analysed at the southwest baltic sea coast. In total, 894 vegetation plots were evaluated in order to determine vegetation changes along the sea-inland gradient due to different levels of human accessibility at beaches. Releves were conducted as repeated transects from the beach ridge to the shore. Shifts in vegetation characteristics due to different levels of tourism access were analysed at the level of plant communities and plant species traits. Results: species richness did not differ significantly between the levels of accessibility. Vegetation cover significantly increased with distance to the shore and was highest in the upper shore area of closed beaches (52.0 +/- 2.7%). Corresponding to the increase in beach access, we observed an increase in ruderal species and a decrease in typical beach species of the vegetation class honckenyo-elymetea. Tourism access and distance to the shoreline had a decisive influence on the distribution of plants with selected plant traits. In particular, at accessible sites, a loss of plants with leaves having high scleromorphy was recorded. Conclusions: increased beach access results in a loss of typical beach plant species. Changes in vegetation characteristics are considered to alter the function of the beach ecosystem. Based on these results, we derived spatially differentiated management measures for excluding the most sensitive beach areas from tourism."

We analysed the ecological constraints and the conservation status of the eastern population of helianthemum caput-felis boiss. (Cistaceae), located in sardinia. The distribution of h. Caput-felis was verified via field surveys; ecological data, morphological and reproductive traits, were recorded in 40 permanent plots randomly established; the human trampling effects on plant density, plant size and plant performance were analysed. Plant density was higher in bedrock and lowland areas, in garrigue and maquis habitats; however, the differences among plants growing in different ecological conditions were not statistically significant; only human trampling intensity significantly affected plant density and lowest values were observed in areas with intense trampling pressure. All ecological variables analysed had a statistically significant effect on plant size and on the number of fruits per plant. In particular, larger plants were found in areas with the following ecological features: presence of structured soil, on the slopes, in the maquis habitat, and in areas with intensive human trampling. Conversely, plants displayed a higher fruits output per plant in deep and structured soil, in lowland areas, and in the garrigue and maquis habitats; the mean fruits output per plant increased as human trampling intensified. Human-induced threats are the main hazards threatening the remaining sardinian population. In particular, the major threats are linked to tourism and other outdoor activities (i.e. Human trampling), followed by the expansion of agricultural activities; all of these threats result in the disappearance of small localities and in reduced population size due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Our study indicates that h. Caput-felis should be considered as critically endangered (cr) at the regional level. Urgent measures should be undertaken to protect the remaining h. Caput-felis population in sardinia and a possible integrated strategy for the conservation and management consists of a combination of in situ and ex situ measures. In particular, greater emphasis should be given to minimizing the negative impacts of unsustainable tourism and recreation use, in order to exclude human trampling and to facilitate the plant recruitment process and population renewal. In addition, an ex situ conservation strategy must be implemented and the seeds collected could be used for future translocations in suitable areas. Moreover, considering the threats observed, a long-term monitoring programme must be developed to reveal changes in the species conservation status."

We investigated five sites on the northern shore of moorea, french polynesia, and quantified the number of visitors on the beach and in shallow water. In field surveys, we measured total coral cover and colony sizes of two common genera, porites and acropora, a massive and branching morphology, respectively. One site, which hosted over an order of magnitude more people than the other four, had significantly less total coral cover and supported very little branching acropora. In addition, size frequency distributions of both the branching and massive genera were skewed toward smaller colony sizes at the high use site.

The random quadrat method was employed in each grove for enumeration of tree diversity and regeneration status. A total of 98 tree species belonging to 38 families were found from the sampled areas. These groves possess higher diversity and basal area. Some 67 % of species have shown regeneration, while 17 % of species had no regeneration. Another 15 % of species were reappearing or immigrating. It is observed that increased disturbance was directly proportional to number of reappearing or immigrating species and inversely proportional to the diversity in all the sacred groves. Significant impact on diversity, species richness and regeneration status of the flora due to manifold anthropogenic activities have been recorded."
481,12,100,Xutong,not vetted,2923,On the suitability of input output analysis for calculating product-specific biodiversity footprints,MORAN DANIEL;PETERSONE MILDA;VERONES FRANCESCA,2016,"Recently it has been estimated that one third of biodiversity threats are driven by consumer demand from outside the country in which the threat occurs. This occurs when the production of export goods exerts pressure on vulnerable populations. While population biologists have in cases been able to establish links between species threats and the causative industry(s), little has been done to trace this biodiversity footprint from the directly implicated industry out to final consumers, a step that would open a wider variety of policy responses. Here we investigate the suitability of multi-region input-output (mrio) analysis for tracing out links between particular species threats, directly implicated industries, and the countries and consumer goods sectors ultimately driving these industries. Environmentally extended mrio models are understood to provide reliable results at a macroeconomic level but uncertainty increases as the models are used to investigate individual sectors, companies, and products. In this study we examine several case studies (nickel mining in new caledonia, coltan from the democratic republic of congo, cut flowers from kenya, and forestry in papua new guinea) in order to understand how and when mrio techniques can be useful for studying biodiversity implicated supply chains. The study was conducted using the eora global input-output database that documents >5 billion global supply chains. Calculating the biodiversity footprint at this level of detail, between specific threats, supply chains, and consumer goods, has not been done before. These case studies provide interesting insights in their own right and also serve to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of using input-output analysis techniques to calculate detailed biodiversity footprints. We conclude that mrio analysis, while no panacea, can be useful for outlining supply chains and identifying which consumption sectors and trade and transformation steps can be subjected to closer analysis in order to enable remedial action.

To understand the impacts of tourism, it is important to first identify the ecological characteristics of damaged forest vegetation. Here, we investigate different ecological patterns in disturbed and undisturbed regions of wutai mountain, china. Comparisons between disturbed and undisturbed forest community were conducted using two-way indicator species analysis (twinspan) and detrended correspondence analysis (dca). The twinspan analysis identified 13 association types from 76 total samples collected. The dca correlation analysis showed that forest community was significantly affected by physiographical factors (such as elevation and slope) in the undisturbed region; however, that was correlated with not only physiographical factors but also intensity of tourism, and the effect of tourism disturbance was stronger than that of physiographical factors in the disturbed regions. In addition, some indicator species were discovered. Our findings provide valuable information about conservation and management of sustainable tourism in the region."

With the rapid development of the industrial society, everyone began to realize that the limited space currently used by human beings cannot meet the urgent needs of today's social development. Human beings are accelerating the change of terrestrial ecosystems, causing the destruction and even subversion of the ecosystem to make biodiversity in ecosystems unpredictable. In order to change this bad situation, protected areas such as ecological reserves and national parks have been set up around the world. At the same time, a large number of endangered animals were recorded on the rare animal protection list and the relevant rare animal protection laws were improved. It can be seen that the issue of biodiversity conservation in ecosystems is receiving more and more attention. The rapid development of tourism has contributed more and more to the economies of the world, and the development prospects are quite broad. The world tourism organization predicts that by 2021 china will become the world's largest tourist destination and the fourth largest tourist source country. At present, there is a wave of urbanization and tourism popularization in the world, and the original ecological environment has been seriously damaged. In order to deal with the contradiction between the development of tourism industry and the protection of animal diversity in nature reserves, the international environmental protection conference proposed a groundbreaking slogan ""ecotourism"", which aims to develop an eco-friendly tourism industry. Since then, governments around the world have responded to this call and have promulgated a series of policies on ecotourism development. Developing eco-tourism in places such as nature reserves and forest parks, although providing financial support for the development and construction of nature reserves from an economic perspective, from an ecological point of view, tourism as an interference activity, it gives the environment of forest ecosystems and nature reserves has had a negative impact. The contradictory relationship between the resulting ecotourism and the biodiversity conservation function of nature reserves has attracted the attention and research of scholars at home and abroad. In response to these problems, this paper studies the impact of forest tourism on the biodiversity of nature reserves. It aims to explore how to develop ecotourism resources without destroying the natural environment, destroying forests, and not affecting biodiversity in ecosystems."

Conservation research for migratory birds in the tropics has focused overwhelmingly on shade coffee plantations and adjacent forest, but both cover types are now in decline, creating an urgent need to evaluate conservation opportunities in other agricultural systems. Here we compare how a community of 42 neotropical migratory bird species and a subset of five conservation-priority species differ in usage and habitat associations among a secondary forest baseline and four expanding commercial plantation systems in guatemala: african oil palm, teak, rubber, and mixed-native hardwoods. We found that mixed-native hardwood plantations supported the highest richness and diversity of all migrants and that the three hardwood plantation types generally outperformed oil palm in richness and diversity metrics. Despite this, oil palm supported high abundance of several common and widespread species also experiencing range-wide population declines and may therefore play an important role in conserving common species. Mature secondary forest hosted low abundance and diversity of the full migratory community, but high abundance and richness of conservation priority migrants along with native hardwood and teak plantations. Likewise, the percentage of forest cover on the landscape was positively associated with priority migrant abundance and richness but negatively associated with the abundance of migrants in general, highlighting how individual species within the broad group of neotropical migratory landbirds respond differently to anthropogenic changes in land use. Across all cover types, the retention of tall overstory trees increased the abundance, richness, and diversity of all migrants, which indicates that vertical structural diversity and remnant trees are important habitat features for birds in agricultural landscapes. Our findings show that conservation opportunities exist in hardwood and oil palm plantations, though the species likely to benefit from conservation action will vary among plantation types. For the subset of conservation priority migrants, our results suggest that conservation efforts should combine strategies that retain and restore secondary forest, promote the adoption of native hardwood and teak plantations, and promote the retention of tall, remnant trees in agricultural landscapes."

We used data from 41 park-wide line transect surveys in 2009 and 2014 and multi-season occupancy models with multi-species data to explore trends in species richness and distribution of individual species and factors affecting these trends in nyungwe national park (nnp), rwanda. Mammalian species richness and the distributional range of 5 of the 7 species increased between 2009 and 2014 in nnp. The probability of colonization of a species into a new area in 2014, where it was not present in 2009, was highest in sites with a lower probability of poaching activity, close to tourist trails, and at lower elevations. The probability of colonization with no poaching activity was about 50% but dropped to about 10% with a 100% chance of poaching activity. Duiker species had the largest increase in distribution during the study, while there was a decrease in the distribution of the eastern chimpanzee and blue monkey. Our results suggest that increased patrols could be implemented in areas of the park with low species richness and areas with a low probability of occurrence for species of conservation concern to combat poaching activity and thus increase the probability of a species moving into a new area. Our use of a single multi-season model for multiple species explicitly accounts for imperfect detection and species-specific identities, while allowing for inferences to be made about rarely detected species by sharing covariates with common species. These results can be used to improve conservation planning in nnp for species management and ranger patrol protocols, and our modelling framework is broadly applicable to any protected area with presence/absence species field data."

Rocky reefs have major seasonal changes that can affect fish abundance and diversity. Ecological studies on the north-patagonian reef ecosystems are scarce. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential changes in the fish assemblage composition of a rocky reef in the san matias gulf. An abundance reduction of fish species is expected after more than 20 years of anthropogenic impacts. The assemblage variation and its relationship with environmental traits were evaluated over one year. Fish species abundance was recorded using scuba diving in the parque submarino las grutas. The newly obtained results were compared to a previous study by gonzalez (1993). The results showed that the fish assemblage composition is identical to that in the 1990s, consisting of five warm-tempered species (diplodus argenteus, pinguipes brasilianus, acanthistius patachonicus, serranus auriga and pseudopercis semifasciata) and a single record of a cold-tempered species (congiopodus peruvianus). However, in terms of abundance, an increase was observed for all species. Species such as d. Argenteus and s. Auriga nearly doubled and tripled their abundance, respectively, compared to the 1990 levels. Environmental factors such as sea temperature rise and primary production upturn could promote an increase in the fish population numbers and/or the migration of fish from nearby populations. Throughout the year, the species showed a tendency coupled with temperature, giving that all the species showed greater abundances at the end of the warm season (april). In this study, we demonstrate the need of long-tern ecological studies in order to evaluate the condition of our coastal ecosystems to help establish management and conservation measures that preserve them over time."

This heavily forested region contains important breeding habitat for many neotropical migratory songbirds, including several species of conservation concern. Our goal'was to examine effects of unconventional gas development on forest habitat and breeding songbirds at a predominantly forested site from 2008 to 2015. Construction of gas well pads and infrastructure (e.g., roads, pipelines) contributed to an overall 4.5% loss in forest cover at the site, a 12.4% loss in core forest, and a 51.7%,increase in forest edge density. We evaluated the relationship between land-cover metrics and species richness within three avian guilds: forest interior, early-successional, and synanthropic, in addition to abundances of 21 focal species. Land-cover impacts were evaluated at two spatial extents: a point-level within 100-m and 500-m buffers of each avian survey station, and a landscape-level across the study area (4326 ha). Although we observed variability in species-specific responses, we found distinct trends in long-term response among the three avian guilds. Forest-interior guild richness declined at all points across the site and at points impacted within 100 m by shale gas but did not change at unimpacted points. Early-successional and synanthropic guild richness increased at all points and at impacted points. Our results suggest that shale gas development has the potential to fragment regional forests and alter avian communities, and that efforts to minimize new development in core forests will reduce negative impacts to forest dependent species.

Achieving sustainable exploitation of deep sea resources is challenged due to the huge uncertainty around the many risks posed by human activities on these remote ecosystems and the goods and services they provide. We used a delphi approach, an iterative expert-based survey process, to assess risks to ecosystem services in the north atlantic ocean from climate change (water temperature and ocean acidification), the blue economy (fishing, pollution, oil and gas activities, deep seabed mining, maritime and coastal tourism and blue biotechnology), and their cumulative effects. Ecosystem services from the deep sea, identified through the millennium ecosystem assessment framework, were presented in an expert survey to assess the impacts of human drivers on these services. The results from this initial survey were analyzed and then presented in a second survey. The final results, based on 55 expert responses, indicated that pollution and temperature change each pose a high risk to more than 28% of deepsea ecosystem services, whilst ocean acidification, and fisheries both pose a high risk to more than 19% of the deep-sea ecosystem services. Services considered to be most at risk of being impacted by anthropogenic activities were biodiversity and habitat as supporting services, biodiversity as a cultural service, and fish and shellfish as provisioning services. Tourism and blue biotechnology were not seen to cause serious risk to any of the ecosystem services. The negative impacts from temperature change, ocean acidification, fishing, pollution, and oil and gas activities were deemed to be largely more probable than their positive impacts. These results expand our knowledge of how a broad set of deep-sea ecosystem services are impacted by human activities. Furthermore, the study provides input in relation to future priorities regarding research in the atlantic deep sea."

Recent work has shown that disturbed artificial beaches have lower numbers and diversity of interstitial amphipods and isopods when compared to natural beaches. In this study, we collected interstitial crustaceans from six different sandy beaches around okinawa-jima island in may 2018, including heavily disturbed beaches near reclaimed land, artificial tourist beaches (=disturbed environment), and undisturbed, natural beaches far away from anthropogenic disturbances (=control) in order to more fully explore the range of diversity across a full spectrum of environments. We additionally utilized 18s ribosomal dna barcodes and automatic barcode gap discovery (abgd) to identify specimens to operational taxonomic units (otus). Dna barcodes showed 34 otus, and the method was more efficiently able to identify to the species-level, while morphological identifications often were only efficient to the genus or family level. In comparison with former data from 2015 in okinawa, the overall numbers and diversity of amphipods and isopods were lower. Similar to previous results, natural beaches showed higher diversity in comparison with artificial/disturbed beaches. These results suggest that disturbances cause reductions in interstitial crustacean diversity. (C) 2019 elsevier b.v. All rights reserved."

Conspecific And Heterospecific Responses To Perceived Density For Breeding Habitat Selection,KELLY JANICE K;CHIAVACCI SCOTT J;BENSON THOMAS J;WARD MICHAEL P,2018,"Theoretical models of habitat selection often incorporate negative density dependence. Despite strong negative density-dependent effects on habitat selection, more recent studies indicate that animals settle near members of their own (conspecific) and other species (heterospecific) when selecting habitat with social cues. Social cue use for habitat selection is particularly common among songbirds, but few studies have investigated if songbirds use social cues to assess conspecific or heterospecific density (as opposed to just presence/absence) when making settlement decisions. We conducted a playback experiment to evaluate if yellow warblers (setophaga petechia) and willow flycatchers (empidonax traillii), two potential competitors for breeding habitat, use social cues to assess density (conspecific for warblers and heterospecific for flycatchers) when selecting breeding locations at two spatial scales. We simulated yellow warbler density to be high or low at multiple treatment plots (3.14ha) with song playback and then evaluated settlement decisions by comparing yellow warbler and willow flycatcher abundances across plots (broad-scale habitat selection) and individual space use within plots (fine-scale territory establishment). Yellow warbler density treatments did not affect habitat selection by yellow warblers at the broad scale, but caused individuals to cluster territories at high-density treatments. Willow flycatchers were most abundant at high-density treatment plots, but yellow warbler density treatments did not affect territory locations. The results indicate that perceived density affects the habitat selection process for both conspecifics and heterospecifics."

A total of 147 species of molluscs was identified, with gastropods displaying the highest species richness and bivalves the highest abundances, and including five non-indigenous species such as the dominant bryozoan grazer polycerella emertoni. Carnivorous and scavenger gastropods were among the most frequent species, reflecting a diverse benthic community. Seasonal changes were significant, being more acute at 3-4 m than at 10-15 m depth, and were correlated mainly with seawater temperature and percentage of organic matter in the sediment. The high affluence of tourists in summer was coincident with high decreases in species richness and abundance of molluscs, together with a strong siltation of the sediment. Nevertheless, most trophic groups persisted and the trophic diversity was relatively high. Significant relationships were found between the index of trophic diversity and shannon-wiener diversity and evenness indices, suggesting that the identity of the species with its particular trophic trait, together with the balanced distribution of the individuals among the species would be the drivers for the maintenance of the molluscan food web under environmental stress. The abundance of p. Emertoni altered the trophic structure of the molluscan assemblage, bringing the ectoparasite trophic group to an unusual peak of dominance. Soft bottom molluscan assemblages of the bay of tunis should be taken into account in monitoring programs for anthropogenic impacts and for non-indigenous species trends throughout the mediterranean basin."

Despite historical and current disturbances, these areas sometimes still maintain high biological diversity. As only 5% of the european union territory was classified as natural, the permanent grasslands represent overriding value, especially in metropolitan areas. Our aim was to explore protected and adventive plant species in a small and valuable, but till now, not deeply studied area of the densely inhabited 12th district in the metropolitan city budapest (hungary), which is visited by large numbers of people. We compared various historical map sources in order to explain how the extension of the grasslands has changed during the past centuries and, thus, which patches are permanent grassland habitats. We found 29 protected and 1 strictly protected plant species. The highest number of protected plant species and their stands were found in the permanent grasslands. Besides urbanisation, a heavy load of tourism (especially on non-designated routes), off-road mountain biking, airsoft races, some illegal shelters for homeless people and game damage threaten this unique refuge of high natural values.

Their area constantly increased due to deforestation until 1867 and exceeded 20 ha, probably due to the mass increase in livestock grazing; then it stagnated until the 1920s, with a slight decrease due to expanding urban areas. Golf greens appeared, walker and skiing tourism increased and these apparently have not decreased the coverage of grasslands, but surely affected the composition of their species. Recent scrub encroachment and re-forestation caused a further decrease. Our distribution maps show the highest density of protected plant species on the southern slopes (2.4 hectare) that have constantly been grasslands since 1783 to date. Contrarily, the cutting of grasslands from 1861 to date contains only half of their number per area unit. Thus, the number of valuable plant specimens refers to the age of the grassland. Three species occur only in the oldest grasslands. Conservation actions should first and foremost focus on these patches."

To assess its population status, we surveyed its habitats at the kimboza forest reserve and (under different assumptions) estimated the population size of the territorial l. Williamsi based on habitat availability, using pandanus abundance as a proxy. Furthermore, threats to the species, especially the impact of the international pet trade on the population, were studied. Our results suggest a severe population decline, as the observed population size is one third smaller than its potential size based on habitat availability (i.e., pandanus). We estimate that in a period of four and a half years, at least 15% of the potential population were collected for the pet trade, making it a major threat to l. Williamsi next to habitat degradation. Based on our results, we consider this species to be threatened with extinction (critically endangered)."

However, local hydraulic characters will be altered upon spur dikes establishment, resulting in several influence on fish habitat. The purpose of this paper was to reveal the impacts mechanism of spur dikes on fish habitat in a tidal reach through a comprehensive analysis based on some previous neglected aspects, such as fish physiological characters, hydraulic variations and essential factors alterations of the aquatic ecosystem. Hydraulic information around spur dikes was acquired through a 3d hydrodynamic model, and validations of tidal level, velocity and diversion ratio yielded a high accuracy. Turbulent rapid around spur dikes head and mild nearshore environment behind structures have some potentialities to become new spawning grounds, for fish spawning semi-pelagic eggs and fish laying adhesive eggs respectively. Benefitted from effective mixture of water during a tidal cycle, plenty of planktons and organic matters will be brought in and gradually enriched behind structures, thus a favorable feeding ground will appear there. Meanwhile, deflecting flow induced by spur dikes may cause some hazards for survival probability of migratory larval fish. It is drifted off the nearshore into the river middle, where is a higher turbulent intensity and less phytoplankton concentration. In summary, spur dikes possess tremendous ecological effects, i.e. Enriching the eco-hydraulic diversity, not only as a velocity shelter. In addition, research result could afford a sufficient basis for environment conservations to restore aquatic ecosystem with spur dikes."

We used a multi-model ensemble forecasting approach, on 8 years of at-sea censuses of 30 seabird species to identify candidate mpas in the portuguese coast, prioritizing important areas for their conservation based on their occurrence and distribution. We overlapped the outputs generated by the ensemble ecological niche models (eenms) with layers representing important environmental stressors (fishing intensity, ship density and oil pollution risk), and calculated loss in conservation value using them as cost layers. Three key marine areas were identified along the portuguese coast: for breeders, there was a key marine area encompassing the tagus and sado estuaries and berlengas archipelago; for non breeders and migratory species two important areas were identified in the northern and southern coast. The key marine area identified in the northern coast is characterized by high productivity and biodiversity, and can be affected by oil pollution from the refineries and the intensive ship traffic in this area. Also, the area identified in the southern coast of portugal for migratory seabirds overlaps extensively with areas of high fishing activity. Our results show that the important bird and biodiversity areas (ibas) established along the portuguese coast protect more than a third of the areas that we prioritized for breeding species and the official mpas near 65% of the same areas. In contrast, current ibas and national legislation protect less than 4% of the coastal areas that we prioritize for non-breeding species in this study. Our study, combining multi-species distribution with environmental constraints induced by human activities, allowed us to assess the coherence of the portuguese marine planning and identify candidate areas to join the portuguese network of marine protected areas. Our results, employing data from annual at-sea surveys together with the human stressors known to affect the portuguese coast, proved to be an extremely useful strategy to identify spatial conservation areas along the portuguese coast as well as to access the adequacy and consistency of those areas. Despite the constraints of this demanding approach, we are confident that our study provides a reliable strategy to inform marine conservation efforts and management planning in similar coastal environments elsewhere, characterized by strong coastal upwelling movements."

The scale and spatial extent, however, at which wildlife populations are affected, are mostly unclear. Particularly in geographically isolated populations, where restricted habitat availability may preclude a relocation to undisturbed areas, effective habitat reduction may remain underestimated or even unnoticed, when animals stay in disturbed areas and only show small-scale responses. Based on telemetry data, we investigated the spatial and seasonal effects of outdoor recreation - in relation to landscape and vegetation conditions - on western capercaillie tetrao urogallus, considering two scales, home range and within-home range habitat selection. We determined the distance-thresholds up to which recreation infrastructures were avoided and estimated the extent of affected habitat for the isolated black forest (southwestern germany) study population. While outdoor recreation did not affect home range selection, strong effects on habitat use within the home range were detected: distance to recreation infrastructure (hiking and cross-country skiing trails, ski pistes) was the main determinant of habitat selection in winter; in summer, mountain bike trails and hiker's restaurants were avoided up to an average distance of 145 m (ci: 60-1092 m). Around winter-infrastructure, relative avoidance was recorded up to 320 m (ci: 36-327 m), it was reduced, however, when dense understory provided visual cover. Of the entire population area, between 8-20% (summer) and 8-40% (winter) were affected by outdoor recreation, mainly in the high altitudes. Even without evident large-scale shifts in species distribution, local-scale avoidance of outdoor recreation can substantially contribute to effective habitat reduction. Based on our results we recommend a general reduction in recreation infrastructure density in key habitats, the establishment of undisturbed wildlife refuges with a diameter of at least 800 m, as well as enhancing visual protection by maintaining a strip of dense understory along trails."

Although a few species are imperiled as a result of the wildlife trade, the lack of field studies makes it difficult to gauge how serious a threat it is to biodiversity. We used data on changes in bird abundances across space and time and information from trapper interviews to evaluate the effects of trapping wild birds for the pet trade in sumatra, indonesia. To analyze changes in bird abundance over time, we used data gathered over 14 years of repeated bird surveys in a 900-ha forest in southern sumatra. In northern sumatra, we surveyed birds along a gradient of trapping accessibility, from the edge of roads to 5 km into the forest interior. We interviewed 49 bird trappers in northern sumatra to learn which species they targeted and how far they went into the forest to trap. We used prices from sumatran bird markets as a proxy for demand and, therefore, trapping pressure. Market price was a significant predictor of species declines over time in southern sumatra (e.g., given a market price increase of approximately $50, the log change in abundance per year decreased by 0.06 on average). This result indicates a link between the market-based pet trade and community-wide species declines. In northern sumatra, price and change in abundance were not related to remoteness (distance from the nearest road). However, based on our field surveys, high-value species were rare or absent across this region. The median maximum distance trappers went into the forest each day was 5.0 km. This suggests that trapping has depleted bird populations across our remoteness gradient. We found that less than half of sumatra's remaining forests are >5 km from a major road. Our results suggest that trapping for the pet trade threatens birds in sumatra. Given the popularity of pet birds across southeast asia, additional studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and magnitude of the threat posed by the pet trade."

The net production of caco3 will likely decline in the future, from both declining net calcification rates (decreasing calcification and increasing dissolution) and shifts in benthic community composition from calcifying organisms to non-calcifying organisms. Here, we present a framework for hydrochemical studies that allows both declining net calcification rates and changes in benthic community composition to be incorporated into projections of coral reef caco3 production. The framework involves upscaling net calcification rates for each benthic community type using mapped proportional cover of the benthic communities. This upscaling process was applied to the reef flats at one tree and lady elliot reefs (great barrier reef) and shiraho reef (okinawa), and compared to existing data. Future caco3 budgets were projected for lady elliot reef, predicting a decline of 53 % from the present value by end-century (800 ppm co2) without any changes to benthic community composition. A further 5.7 % decline in net caco3 production is expected for each 10 % decline in calcifier cover, and net dissolution is predicted by end-century if calcifier cover drops below 18 % of the present extent. These results show the combined negative effect of both declining net calcification rates and changing benthic community composition on reefs and the importance of considering both processes for determining future reef caco3 production."

There is a consensus that diversification of cropping would support sustainable development. However, a reduction in legume cultivation has been observed in the eu during the last decades. This decline has induced, in turn, a deficit of proteins and a reduction of ecosystem services provided by legumes. Therefore, we analysed the mechanisms that shape agricultural systems to identify leverage points for reviving european legume production. Specifically, we reviewed the factors that affect the market and non-market value of legumes and the relevant agricultural policies. We characterized the decline in legume cropping as an outcome of the dominance of economic forces that favour specialization of production systems over diversification. We found that the value of market outputs of legumes per unit area is relatively low and volatile, with a 25-78 % variation in pea gross margins, which reduces market competitiveness. We observed that the value of system-internal outputs of legumes such as the nitrogen fixed, of 130 to 153 kg n ha(-1); crop protection services that reduce agrochemical costs, by 20-25% in cereals; and yield enhancements of subsequent crops, of 0.2 to 1.6 t ha(-1) in cereals, are often underestimated. In addition, markets fail to translate external effects of legumes such as biodiversity enhancement, reduction in emissions, of up to 50 % in n2o, and soil improvements into economic benefits. Current policies support legumes through selected mechanisms such as ecological focus areas, agri-environmental programmes and sparse coupled support measures. Domestic cultivation of legumes could be supported through trade policies such as import restrictions on genetically modified soybean or new mechanisms to appreciate non-market outputs including payments for ecosystem services and carbon markets. In addition, development of new value chains, niche markets, scaling-up of plant breeding efforts and dissemination of information is required."

We surveyed the site noninvasively using radiotelemetry to determine which of the radio-tagged fish were present (effectively closing the radio-tagged population to emigration) and then electrofished to estimate the proportion of available fish that were captured based on both this and standard mark-recapture methods. We replicated the electrofishing surveys three times over a minimum of 12 days each year, for 7 years. Electrofishing capture probability varied between 0.020 and 0.310 over the 7 years and between four different large-bodied species (murray cod (maccullochella peelii), trout cod (maccullochella macquariensis), golden perch (macquaria ambigua ambigua), and silver perch (bidyanus bidyanus)). River turbidity associated with increased river discharge negatively influenced capture probability. Increasing fish length increased detection of fish up to 500 mm for murray cod, after which capture probability decreased. Variation in capture probability in large lowland rivers results in additional uncertainty when estimating population size or relative abundance. Research and monitoring programs using fish as an indicator should incorporate strategies to lessen potential error that might result from changes in capture probabilities."

In this article, we propose a framework that includes exotic species introduction in an lca context. We derived characterization factors for exotic fish species introduction related to the transport of goods across the rhine-main-danube canal. These characterization factors are expressed as the potentially disappeared fraction (pdf) of native freshwater fish species in the rivers rhine and danube integrated over space and time per amount of goods transported (pdf.m(3).Yr.kg(-1)). Furthermore, we quantified the relative importance of exotic fish species introduction compared to other anthropogenic stressors in the freshwater environment (i.e., eutrophication, ecotoxicity, greenhouse gases, and water consumption) for transport of goods through the rhine-main-danube waterway. We found that the introduction of exotic fish species contributed to 70-85% of the total freshwater ecosystem impact, depending on the distance that goods were transported. Our analysis showed that it is relevant and feasible to include the introduction of exotic species in an lca framework. The proposed framework can be further extended by including the impacts of other exotic species groups, types of water bodies and pathways for introduction."

However, land snails, in particular micro-snails, could reflect the impact of land-use on ecosystem integrity. Because of their size, limited mobility, and propensity to spend their entire lives at one locality due to lack of migratory behavior, micro-snails are susceptible to changes in land-use within forested ecosystems. Therefore, we proposed the hypothesis that micro-snails would reflect land-use in forested ecosystems. We sampled snail communities in paired old-growth and second-growth forests in three distinct ecoregions. Species diversity, richness, and abundance were greater in two of the three old-growth sites compared to paired second-growth sites. Across all of the ecoregions, 21 out of 70 species had an affinity for old-growth. Eighteen of which were statistically significant. These results suggest that anthropogenic disturbance plays a key role in shaping species diversity and community structure of land snail fauna. However, site specific factors also appear to be important moderators of the response, and the mechanisms of the process remain to be studied. Snails appear to be a promising group of organisms to use as indicators of historic forest disturbance. In order to maintain ecological integrity, forest managers should consider management strategies that are low impact and protect existing patches of old-growth forests."

Here, we analyzed the protective effects of cultural diversity on biodiversity. The results show that: (1) the cultural diversity of zhuang ethnic people and local biodiversity are closely interrelated. Rich biodiversity has generated a colorful traditional culture, and the formation and development of traditional culture can directly or indirectly enrich the local biodiversity; (2) the traditional culture and knowledge created of the zhuang people in the long-term living history has greatly promoted the conservation and sustainable use of local biodiversity, and the protection of biodiversity will further guarantee the inheritance of local traditional culture. This paper also discusses the developing status and threatened factors of traditional knowledge and culture.

In st lucia, construction of tourism infrastructure in the coastal dry forest threatens the endangered white-breasted thrasher ramphocinclus brachyurus. Long-term protection of habitat is vital, but design of such conservation action is constrained by lack of data on the species' distribution and population responses to habitat change and fragmentation. Distance sampling surveys were conducted in 2006 and 2007 to estimate numbers and map the distribution of the two remaining sub-populations. White-breasted thrashers in st lucia were estimated to number around 1,200 individuals, with roughly 1,050 birds occupying just over 600 ha of dry forest in the mandele area. We demonstrate that tourist development companies will likely soon own land constituting around 40% of the species' extent of occurrence on st lucia, and nearly 35% globally, and that ongoing and planned tourist developments threaten around one third of the st lucian white-breasted thrasher population. Given the size of these potential impacts, it is vital that patches of dry forest to the west and north of a development site in the mandele area are safeguarded. These sites support white-breasted thrashers at high density and are contiguous with an existing forest reserve. Other important conservation measures include preserving stands of connected mature dry and riparian forest inside the tourist development sites, alongside invasive predator control."

Larvae feed on a wide variety of hosts across their geographic range, but local populations perform best on local host species. Defoliation during outbreaks can strip preferred trees of all foliage and cause substantial branch mortality and growth reduction but generally does not cause much tree mortality, at least not directly. Defoliation in recreational areas reduces visitation because migrating caterpillars are viewed as nuisances and defoliated trees as unsightly. The insects, their frass, and associated damage to ornamental trees and shrubs also are nuisances for homeowners. The current importance of the forest tent caterpillar and its potential to become more important in a warmer climate warrant greater attention to its population dynamics and control options. Because 1) outbreaks of this native insect generally cause little long-term damage to forest values, 2) widespread application of insecticides is cost prohibitive, and 3) forests are increasingly valued as reservoirs of biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services, microbial insecticides, such as bt, spinosad, and baculovirus formulations, are favored over synthetic insecticides for control of this insect when warranted. Other biorational insecticides include azadirachtin (a botanical insecticide) and insecticidal soap. Conventional synthetic insecticides include several pyrethroids (such as bifenthrin and permethrin), organophosphates (such as acephate and malathion), and carbamates (carbaryl), but these have broad nontarget effects that discourage use in forests."

Using a recent high resolution and harmonized global land use map along with (b).

Validating the projected extinctions with iucn red list. We allocate projected extinctions to the agriculture, pasture, urban, and forestry areas used, traded, and consumed in 129 countries, using an environmentally extended global multi-regional input output database. Results show that for the three taxa combined, a total of 927 endemic species are projected to go extinct due to the impacts of current global land use. The taxonomic breakdown is 186 projected mammal extinctions, 170 birds, and 571 amphibians, with global agriculture land use responsible for 267 projected extinctions; pasture 314, forestry 313, and urbanization 32. Importantly, countryside sar projections compare well with the number of extinct and threatened species documented by the iucn red list. We found that land use for export production is responsible for 25% of these projected global extinctions. Our approach enables parametrization of countryside sars in any world region even without extensive field studies, and therefore allows quantitative assessment of biodiversity impacts under alternative land use scenarios. Overall, our approach and findings can inform sustainability assessment of commodity supply-chains as well as specific national actions toward achievement of the aichi 2020 and un sustainable development goals.

Biomonitoring of the disturbed area and a control station shows that elevated temperature is a more significant stressor compared to salinity, thus causing a decrease in abundance and richness. Critical temperature thresholds were observed at 30 and 35 degrees c, the latter representing the most thermally tolerant species in the studied area pararotalia calcariformata, which is the only symbiont-bearing species observed within the core of the heated area.

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

In this research, we evaluated how different habitat characteristics in shade agroforestry plantations influenced the richness and abundance of the overwintering migratory bird community. We examined migratory bird diversity and habitat structure in nine farms with coffee agroforestry systems with different shading regimes during two wintering seasons in southwestern antioquia department, colombia. 15.9 +/- 3.69 species of migratory birds were found on the 9 farms (range 11-21 species). While we found little support for a strong association between richness of migratory birds and habitat variables, abundance of migratory birds was best explained by the combined effect of habitat characteristics. Particularly, the total number of individuals of migratory birds was positively related to structural attributes such as shrub density, canopy cover, tree density and diameter at breast height, suggesting that a denser and closed shading system might be beneficial for migratory birds, which may both increase the horizontal and vertical complexity of the agroforestry system and the variety of food resources for birds. Our surveys showed additional evidence that shaded systems can provide overwinter habitat to neotropical migrant birds in the colombian andes. Moreover, we suggest that migratory birds can benefit by managing structurally and floristically diverse agroforestry and silvopastoral systems."

The main objective of this study is to provide an environmental (coastal vegetation and coral reef condition) and socioeconomic (human population condition) baseline data of a poorly documented and weakly managed zone by the use of a set of rapid assessment methodologies, looking to assist the regional efforts to manage these coastal resources. To achieve this goal we used a series of surveying methods including remote sensing, geographic information systems and in situ land/underwater surveys, to allow a broad characterization of the resources' condition in the study zone. Results showed that reef habitat was dominated by macro-algae (61.2 +/- 7.6%), followed by soft coral (gorgonians, 12.4 +/- 4.1%), hard coral (8.2 +/- 5.1%) and sponges (2.5 +/- 1.3%). Zooanthids and tunicates represented less than 1% of the total; coral and macro algae estimates suggest a decline from records of 15 years ago. Highest fish densities were (144 +/- 124 individuals/100 m(2)), while lowest were (83 +/- 25 individuals/100 m(2)). The total average fish density recorded could also be reflecting a decrease trend in the reef community structure. The main economic activities in the area are fishing and land clearing. From december 2003, 22% (corresponding to 44 ha) of the total original vegetation cover in the studied area was deforested. By february 2007, the deforested area increased 4.4 ha more. Should this tendency continue, by 2025 it would only maintain 24% of its total coastal vegetation cover representing a huge habitat loss. The future of economic activities in these areas lie directly on the establishment of appropriate management strategies for the protection and conservation of the renowned biodiversity that this area comprises.

In the tehran bazar salep trade during may-july 2013 was 1.9 tons of dried tubers, with estimated retail value of 310,000 usd. Current orchid collection practices in iran, which have soared in recent years due to international demand, do not seem sustainable as all tubers are collected destructively. To preserve orchid populations, in the longterm, establishment of specific orchid conservation areas and introduction of sustainable production practices, could alleviate harvesting pressure. In the midterm, development of a dna barcoding-based molecular identification system could help to monitor and control illegal trade. In the near term, effective implementation of collection bans in excessively harvested areas and strengthening of current regulations are necessary to avoid the catastrophic effects of harvesting on orchid populations, as has been observed in turkey."

We propose a novel biodiversity footprint index based on bird extinction risks to evaluate the effects of global wood production and trade on biodiversity. Using 536 endangered bird species threatened by wood harvesting and logging, we calculated the ""quasi-extinction"" probabilities, that is, the probabilities that population sizes become lower than an extinction threshold after habitat loss based on initial population sizes and forest habitat loss rates. We then used bilateral wood trade data to link the biodiversity impacts in wood exporters to wood importers. We found that if recent trends in forest cover loss continue until 2100, bird species in brazil would be the most rapidly and heavily affected by wood production and trade, followed by those in indonesia; these two countries alone would account for about half of all global bird extinctions. Large-scale wood importers (i.e., china, japan, and the united states) significantly elevate overseas extinction risks and, simultaneously, reduce domestic impacts, indicating a heavy responsibility of these countries for global biodiversity loss. We also conducted a scenario analysis, which showed that the total projected number of extinct species would not decrease if each country produced the amount of wood materials necessary to meet current consumption levels. This is because bird extinction risks in tropical wood importers, such as mexico and the philippines, as well as japan and china will increase if these countries increase domestic wood production. Our biodiversity footprint index is useful to identify countries whose bird species are highly affected by wood production and trade, and to quantify the role of wood trade in bird species extinctions. Additional scenario analyses are needed to establish effective patterns of wood production and consumption for bird biodiversity conservation. (C) 2016 elsevier ltd. All rights reserved."

Such systems are essential components of the livelihoods of small-holder farmers in kenya and for in situ conservation of intraspecific and interspecific diversity. Using a mixed methods approach combining interviews, focus groups, and a household survey, we identify that the distribution of crop varieties in tharaka, kenya, has been shaped by both human migrations that have transported seeds and gender roles that have restricted travel and utilization of local indigenous varieties during early migrations. Our results suggest that the migrations of the first tharaka people from mbwa 300 years ago have influenced the concentration of local indigenous varieties in the areas of first settlement today. Subsequent smaller migrations dictated by men within tharaka through the 1960s, particularly to the northern areas, originally limited the distribution of crops, such as pearl millet (pennisetum glaucum), that are dependent on women for seed selection and processing. This study offers a specific case where the consideration of human migration and gender roles, currently and historically, have influenced the distribution of crop biodiversity, and thus farmer access, to specific types of varieties within a single region and ethnic group."

Among them, exotic seed chalcids in the genus megastigmus invaded europe as a result of the rapidly-increasing and mostly unregulated seed trade for afforestation and ornamental plantations. Unlike their economic impact in seed orchards, until recently, little attention was paid to the ecological impact of these insects. In the present study, selected case studies of alien megastigmus spp. Were considered to assess their specific impact on the potential of natural regeneration of native woody plants and on the native entomofauna competing for seed resource. We re-analyzed data from former studies that did not focus on these ecological interactions and, here, present previously unpublished results. Seeds of douglas-fir, true cedars, true firs and wild roses were sampled all over europe, and the relative importance of the native and invasive chalcid species was assessed as well as their specific impact on seed yield. In most cases, the recent arrival of alien chalcids resulted in a significant decrease in the regeneration potential of the host trees. In the absence of competitors, alien chalcids occupied the entire seed niche in douglas-fir, but their impact tended to decrease after the arrival of invasive seed bugs. In firs, alien chalcids tended to displace the native chalcids, but not in wild roses and cedars, where their damage was increasing. Different biological traits that might explain invasive success of alien chalcids are discussed. However, no general invasive patterns seem to exist."

To evaluate the extent to which tourism and recreation may be threatening process for plants, we conducted a continental level review of listed threats to endangered vascular plants using data from australia. Of the 659 vascular plant species listed as critically endangered or endangered by the australian government, tourism and recreation were listed as a threat(s) for 42%. This is more than those listed as threatened by climate change (26%) and close to the proportion listed as threatened by altered fire regimes (47%). There are plant species with tourism and recreation listed threats in all states and territories and from all but one bioregion in australia. Although more than 45 plant families have species with tourism and recreation listed as threats, orchids were the most common species listed as at risk from these threats (90 species). The most common types of threats listed were visitors collecting plants in protected areas (113 species), trampling by hikers and others (84 species), damage from recreational vehicles (59 species) and road infrastructure (39 species). Despite the frequency with which tourism and recreation were listed as threats in australia, research quantifying these threats and methods to ameliorate their impacts are still limited. Although this lack of information contributes to the challenge of managing tourism and recreation, impacts from visitors will often be easier to manage within natural areas than those from larger scale threats such as altered fire regimes and climate change.

To test this, fish-assemblage data from 23 years of monitoring in the araguari reservoir cascade system, upper parana river basin, were analysed. The results showed a clear reduction in richness of native and migratory fish species and an increase of non-native species, following reservoir formation. Migratory species richness was higher in reservoirs that presented habitats similar to lotic stretches or tributaries upstream of the impounded area. There was a clear tendency for native species to decline and non-native fish species to increase, in a downstream direction. Fish assemblages became increasingly dissimilar as reservoirs became more distant from each other (longitudinal gradient) and were dominated by small and medium-sized species. Alongside longitudinal position, reservoir area, age and the presence of herbivorous non-native fish were found to be important predictors of variation in fish-assemblage structure. Results from the present study help clarify the potential accumulated impacts of reservoir cascades on fish diversity, which must be carefully considered in river-basin inventories for hydropower plants, and reinforce the importance of long-term monitoring, considering longitudinal and lateral dimensions of the basin."

The overall density of all the birds fell to about 1/3, and the closer from the road, the lower degree of the birds richness. Highway corridor effect, especially traffic noise, affects birds breeding rate; when the equivalent consecutive sound level a on bird habitat is more than 50db round the clock, the bird breeding density decreases from 20% to 98%, and the birds who born in the road area spread to the habitat which is far away from the road for breeding. Avian phototaxis caused many birds hitting on the lighted buildings or vehicles at night. The exposed power lines along the highway are also a risk factor for a pair of cranes, eagles and other large birds. Hence, it proposes highway construction environmental technology to reduce the adverse effects of the construction and operation of the highway on the birds, and also provides a reference for highway construction biodiversity conservation."

While being disproportionately represented in the marine ornamental fish trade, only a handful of taxonomically restricted studies explored their biogeographic history and the evolution body size and trophic guilds. Here, we reconstruct the phylogenetic history for 70 pomacanthid species (85% of nominal species), based on previously published data for three nuclear and four mitochondrial markers. We use the resulting phylogenetic framework to explore the ancestral biogeography and ecological diversification of the family. Divergence times and ancestral range estimation highlight the origins of the family most likely lie in the central pacific region. Vicariance among ocean basins reflects the impact of the terminal tethyan event and the closure of the isthmus of panama in the historical biogeography of pomacanthus and holacanthus genera. The reconstruction also uncovers ancestral colonization pathways via the pacific ocean into the western atlantic waters for holacanthus. We confirm the indian ocean invasion scenario previously proposed for the ""acanthops"" complex (genus: centropyge). Finally, interspecific variation in body size among clades appeared to be correlated to some degree with trophic guilds, whereby 15% of variance in body size was explained by trophic modes. This suggests that the higher ecological diversification observed in the centropyge glade might be promoted by smaller body sizes acting as an ecological novelty allowing the expansion of the genus within available niches."

We provide an assessment of by-catch from fishing gears (fyke, trawl, set trammel, and drift trammel nets) commonly used in small-scale fisheries across the globe, using a representative sri lankan case study and placing this in the context of local resource use patterns. We reveal evidence of how ssf generate significant finfish by-catch with potentially significant ecological impacts. Fishers targeting shrimp (fyke, trawl, and drift trammel nets) caught more non-target species than global averages (44, 44, and 67% by weight, respectively). Fishers targeting finfish (set trammel nets) caught fewer non-target species. We found that by-catch depends more on target species and gear type, supporting suggestions that ssf are not ""inherently more sustainable"" than their large-scale counterparts and a collective effort is required for an improved understanding of the impacts of ssf. This study highlights an additional issue of valuable food fish discards, raising questions about fisheries exploitation in the context of food security in areas where poverty and food insecurity are prevalent."

Due to the creep property of timber and bamboo, long-term loading has a great influence on natural wood and bamboo members from the perspectives of failure mode, bearing capacity, stiffness and deformation. Based on long-term loading experiment, the experiments on long-term loaded beam (long-term beam), regulated long-term loaded beam (regulated beam), ordinary beam were compared in this paper. The result shows that the typical failure modes of the prestressed glued bamboo-lumber beams include tensile failure at the bottom of the midspan, local compressive failure at the bottom of the support section, tensile failure atop the support section. In the comparative test in terms of ultimate bearing capacity, compared with ordinary beam: when the numbers of steel wires used on the beam are 2,4,6 respectively, the ultimate bearing capacity of long-term beam turns from an decrease of 5.71% to an increase of 3.32% and 33.51%; when the total prestress value increases, the increase extent of long-term beam's ultimate bearing capacity decreases; and when the proportion of external load changes, the ultimate bearing capacity of long-term beam decreases. By changing the quantity of steel wires and total prestress value, the ultimate bearing capacity of long-term beam can be improved. The increase extent correlates with the quantity of steel wires positively and correlates with the total prestress value negatively. And the change of external load's proportion made long-term beam's ultimate bearing capacity decrease. Due to the change of failure mode, regulated beams' ultimate bearing capacity surpasses ordinary beams' universally. The stiffness of glued bamboo-lumber beam can be changed through the creep of bamboo-lumber composite and the regulating of pretress. Although the ultimate deformation capacity of most of the long-term beams decreases a little bit, it can also meet engineering requirement."

However, the dynamics of the physical and biological fluxes at the lagoon-ocean interface remain poorly characterized. Here, we studied the combined effects of lagoon-ocean water exchanges and local environmental conditions on the phyto- and zooplankton abundance and community structure across the atoll lagoon rim of ahe (tuamotu archipelago, french polynesia). Plankton and environmental variables were monitored in may 2013 (i) at several stations inside and outside the lagoon and (ii) during time-series corresponding to ebb-flood tidal cycles in the two types of channels connecting the lagoon to the ocean: at the passage (300 m long and about 11 m deep) and in hoa (i.e reef-flat less than 50 cm depth). Our results highlight tidally-driven selective plankton exchanges between the lagoon and external ocean. Phytoplankton (chlorophyll-a) and zooplankton biomass were respectively 4 times and 7 times higher in the lagoon than at stations outside the atoll lagoon. Copepoda was the dominant zooplanlcton group at the oceanic station (>75% abundance) whereas meroplankton (with bivalve larvae most common) was dominant at the lagoon stations (54%), in the passage (55-82%) and in hoa (>80%). These differences between sites suggest a loss of bivalve larvae through export to the ocean and retention and/or increased production of copepods in the lagoon. The daily export of bivalve larvae represents a low percentage of the lagoon stock, in agreement with previously published larval dispersal numerical models. The retention of copepods could constitute a significant input of nutrients and organic matter (through excretion, feces release, decomposition, and remineralization) into the lagoon.

In australia, feral cats have caused decline and extinction of native mammals, but their time of introduction and origin is unclear. Here, we investigate hypotheses of cat arrival pre- or post-european settlement, and the potential for admixture between cats of different invasion events. We analyse the genetic structure and diversity of feral cats from six locations on mainland australia, seven australian islands and samples from southeast asia and europe using microsatellite and mitochondrial dna data. Results: our results based on phylogeographic model selection are consistent with a european origin of cats in australia. We find genetic distinctiveness of australian mainland samples compared with dirk hartog island, flinders island, tasman island and cocos (keeling) island samples, and genetic similarities between some of the island populations. Historical records suggest that introduction of cats to these islands occurred at the time of european exploration and/or in connection with the pearling, whaling and sealing trades early in the 19th century. On-going influx of domestic cats into the feral cat population is apparently causing the australian mainland populations to be genetically differentiated from those island populations, which likely are remnants of the historically introduced cat genotypes. Conclusion: a mainly european origin of feral cats in australia, with possible secondary introductions from asia following the initial establishment of cats in australia is reasonable. The islands surrounding australia may represent founding populations and are of particular interest. The results of the study provide an important timeframe for the impact of feral cats on native species in australia."

Sites were divided into three categories based on the width of the riparian buffer (< 25 m, 25-75 m, and > 75 m) and surveyed three times each during the breeding season. In total, 56 species of birds were identified, including 25 species of neotropical migrants. A positive correlation was noted between neotropical species richness and riparian buffer width, however no difference in species richness was noted between medium and wide sites suggesting that widening riparian buffers to 75 m in the agricultural midwest would be a practical conservation target and help protect all but the most area-sensitive species such as acadian flycatcher (empidonax virescens) and wood thrush (hylocichla mustelina). Vegetative characteristics had little impact on species richness in our study likely because our sites were generally homogeneous and unmanaged."

Thus, an indirect effect could be hypothesized at the italian latitudes, with warmer areas potentially more likely to be visited by tourists than colder areas.

They are also popular for human recreation. Increasing demands for tourism means that infrastructure in alpine resorts is expanding. Consequently, habitat is being modified and fragmented, potentially adversely affecting fauna. However, research investigating the effects of ski resorts on wildlife, particularly reptiles, is limited, and the effectiveness of management strategies in mitigating adverse impacts is unknown. To quantify the effects of ski-related disturbances on specialist and generalist reptile species, we surveyed sites in disturbed and undisturbed subalpine habitats. We also examined vegetation composition and habitat structure to determine whether structural or compositional habitat features were driving patterns of reptile occurrence. Our results indicate that the effects of ski-related disturbance varied between species, but that adverse effects - particularly on ski runs - were more pronounced for specialists. Given that each species studied was positively associated with compositional or structural features of the environment, we argue that alterations to these habitat attributes when creating ski runs will suppress lizard abundances in these areas. However, while ski runs have an adverse effect on reptiles, the persistence of these animals in ski resorts can be facilitated by retaining habitat structure and minimizing disturbance to native vegetation."

These managed flows contrast with ""natural"", large-scale, overbank flood pulses. We compared the effects of a managed and a natural connection event on (i) the composition of the large-bodied fish community and (ii) the structure of an endangered catfish population of a large floodplain lake. The change in community composition following the managed connection was not greater than that exhibited between seasons or years during disconnection. By contrast, the change in fish community structure following the natural connection was much larger than that attributed to background, within-and between-year variability during disconnection. Catfish population structure only changed significantly following the natural flood. While the natural flood increased various population rates of native fishes, it also increased those of non-native carp, a pest species. To have a positive influence on native biodiversity, environmental flows may need to be delivered to floodplains in a way that simulates the properties of natural flood pulses. A challenge, however, will be managing river-floodplain connectivity to benefit native more than non-native species."

During the sampling period, a total of 55 fish species were recorded, with the lake-river migratory fish species dominating abundance all the time. Hierarchical clustering analysis found four temporal fish assemblages: feb-mar, apr-jun, jul-sep and oct-jan, which was consistent with the rising and falling of water temperature and water level. The movement index was used to measure the direction of fish migration, which was found closely associated with variations of water temperature, water level and flow discharge. Particularly, when water temperature and water level rose from march to july, fish migration showed the tendency of entering the lake; when they receded from august to february of the next year, fish migration showed the opposite tendency. Based on our results, we concluded that maintaining the river-lake connection is essential for the river-lake migratory fishes and the natural flow regime was the key driver in this floodplain ecosystem."

In the mediterranean, sea-based tourism and related recreational activities are increasing rapidly, especially within marine protected areas (mpas) hosting emblematic biodiversity. We investigated the impact of ecotourism in the scandola mpa (unesco world heritage site, corsica island), on the population of a conservation flagship, the osprey pandion haliaetus. Over the 37-year study period, tourists flow increased sharply. Osprey breeding performance initially increased, but then dropped for pairs nesting within the mpa compared to those breeding elsewhere in corsica. We examined several hypotheses that could explain such reduction in breeding performance. Recent osprey breeding failures in the mpa are not caused by food scarcity. Using underwater fish surveys, we showed that fish consumed by ospreys were more numerous within the mpa. Focal observation at nests revealed that the overall number of boat passages within 250 m of osprey nests were three times higher inside the mpa compared to a control area. Elevated boat traffic significantly modified osprey time-budgets, by decreasing prey provisioning rate by males, and increasing time spent alarming and flying off the nest in females. This caused stress, and corticosterone levels in chick feathers were three times higher in high-traffic areas compared to places with lower touristic flow in corsica, the balearic islands and italy. Overall, our integrative, long-term study demonstrates the negative impact of sea-based ecotourism on the corsican osprey population.

In recent decades, invasive plants, such as russian olive (elaeagnus angustifolia), have achieved broad distribution and local dominance in many western riparian areas, raising concerns over the loss of ecological function within these systems. In 2005 and 2006 we conducted avian point counts and surveyed vegetation cover at 95 points along the snake and columbia rivers in southeastern washington to investigate the effects of total woody vegetation cover and the relative proportion of russian olive cover on breeding and wintering riparian bird communities. Our results indicated that riparian habitats dominated by russian olive can support diverse and abundant bird communities, though cavity nesting species were noticeably sparse. Bird density and species richness were best explained by a quadratic relationship to total woody vegetation cover in both seasons, as was breeding bird community composition, with greatest density and richness in intermediate cover levels. We found no indication that the proportion of the woody vegetation comprised of russian olive strongly influenced any of these bird community metrics. Given that russian olive comprised 81.6% of the riparian vegetation in our study area, it is unclear from our results how russian olive would affect bird communities in regions where native vegetation is more abundant. Regardless, complete eradication of russian olive from riparian systems where the plant is a major component will reduce the overall habitat value for birds by eliminating significant structural complexity."

The primary aim of this study was to assess the relative importance of international trade and several environmental variables of the recipient region on species richness of established exotic scolytinae. As a reference, we also evaluated the relationships between the same environmental variables and species richness of native scolytinae. Using an information-theoretic framework for model selection and hierarchical partitioning, we evaluated the relative importance of the potential drivers of species richness of native and exotic scolytinae in 20 european countries and the 48 contiguous continental us states. Analyses were conducted separately for ambrosia and bark beetle species. Value of imports was a strong predictor of the number of exotic scolytinae species in both regions. In addition, in the usa, warmer and wetter climate was positively linked to increased numbers of both native and exotic ambrosia beetles. Forest heterogeneity and climatic heterogeneity and secondarily forest area were key drivers in explaining patterns of species richness for native bark beetles but not for exotic species in both regions. Our findings suggest that if current infestation levels continue on imported plants and wood packaging material, increasing international trade will likely lead to more establishments of exotic scolytinae with concomitant negative effects on forest health in both europe and the usa. Compared to europe the risk of invasion appears higher in the usa, especially for ambrosia beetles in the southeastern usa where the climate appears highly suitable for exotic establishment."

Insight from simple, bivariate relationships so far has been limited. We combined >11,000 community plots in the french alps with a molecular phylogeny and trait information for >1200 plant species to simultaneously investigate the relationships between all major biodiversity dimensions and satellite-sensed productivity. Using an approach that tests for differential effects of species dominance, species similarity and the interplay between phylogeny and traits, we demonstrate that unimodal productivity-biodiversity relationships only dominate for taxonomic diversity. In forests, trait and phylogenetic diversity typically increase with productivity, while in grasslands, relationships shift from unimodal to declining with greater land-use intensity. High productivity may increase trait/phylogenetic diversity in ecosystems with few external constraints (forests) by promoting complementary strategies, but under external constraints (managed grasslands) successful strategies are similar and thus the best competitors may be selected."

Forestry practices have been linked with low diversity and abundance of amphibians. The effect of exotic eucalyptus spp. Plantations on amphibian communities has been studied in a number of biodiversity hotspots, but little is known of its impact in the mediterranean region. Here, we identify the environmental factors influencing the presence of six species of amphibians (the caudata pleurodeles waltl, salamandra salamandra, lissotriton boscai, triturus marmoratus and the anurans pelobates cultripes and hyla arborea/meridionalis) occupying 88 ponds. The study was conducted in a mediterranean landscape dominated by eucalypt plantations alternated with traditional use (agricultural, montados and native forest) at three different scales: local (pond), intermediate (400 metres radius buffer) and broad (1000 metres radius buffer). Using the akaike information criterion for small samples (aicc), we selected the top-ranked models for estimating the probability of occurrence of each species at each spatial scale separately and across all three spatial scales, using a combination of covariates from the different magnitudes. Models with a combination of covariates at the different spatial scales had a stronger support than those at individual scales. The presence of predatory fish in a pond had a strong effect on caudata presence. Permanent ponds were selected by hyla arborea/meridionalis over temporary ponds. Species occurrence was not increased by a higher density of streams, but the density of ponds impacted negatively on lissotriton boscai. The proximity of ponds occupied by their conspecifics had a positive effect on the occurrence of lissotriton boscai and pleurodeles waltl. Eucalypt plantations had a negative effect on the occurrence of the newt lissotriton boscai and anurans hyla arborea/meridionalis, but had a positive effect on the presence of salamandra salamandra, while no effect on any of the other species was detected. In conclusion, eucalypts had limited effects on the amphibian community at the intermediate and broad scales, but predatory fish had a major impact when considering all the scales combined. The over-riding importance of introduced fish as a negative impact suggests that forest managers should prevent new fish introductions and eradicate fish from already-occupied ponds whenever possible."

However, there are no studies assessing the combined effects on fish caused by several adjacent dams and their reservoirs, as in a 'dam cascade'. This study predicts the potential effects that a cascade of ten dams currently under construction in the upper yangtze river in china will have on local fishes, and uses such predictions to assess the effectiveness of possible fish conservation measures. We found that the dam cascade will have serious combined effects on fishes mainly due to impoundment, habitat fragmentation and blocking, flow regime modification, and hypolimnetic discharges. The impoundments will cause loss of critical habitats for 46 endemic species. The dams will fragment the populations of 134 species and will block migration routes for 35 potamodromous fishes. Corieus guichenoti will have a high risk of extinction due to the combined effects of impoundment and blocking. Modification of the flow regime will adversely affect the recruitment of 26 species that produce drifting eggs. The start of annual spawning for 13 fishes will be postponed by more than 1 month, and fish spawning and growth opportunities will be reduced due to low water temperatures associated with hypolimnetic discharges. Combined dam effects will further reduce the likelihood of successful recruitment of some endangered species, such as acipenser dabryanus and psephurus gladius. Three countermeasures hold promise to mitigate the near-term effects of the dam cascade, including preservation and rehabilitation of critical habitat, restoration of a semi-natural flow regime, and stock enhancement that respects genetic integrity. These conclusions can guide the development of protection plans for fishes in the upper yangtze river. The approach undertaken in this study-by which the known and likely effects of present and future dams were simultaneously considered in light of the biology of the species-highlights the usefulness of ichthyology for fish conservation."

We asked three questions: (a) does trampling increase the drift rate of aquatic macroinvertebrates and organic matter? (B) does trampling change the macroinvertebrate community organization? (C) if trampling alters the community structure, is a short time (5 days, a between weekends interval - peaks of tourism activities) sufficient for community restructuring? Analysis of variance of richness, total abundance, abundance of the most abundant genus (e.g., simothraulopsis and callibaetis), and community composition showed that trampling immediately affects macroinvertebrate community and that the intervals between the peaks of visitation (5 days) are not sufficient to complete community restructuring. Considering that bathing areas receive thousands of visitors every year and that intervals of time without visitation are nearly nonexistent, we suspect that the negative effects on the macroinvertebrate community occur in a cumulative way. Finally, we discuss some simple procedures that could potentially be used for reducing trampling impacts in lotic environments."

Lack of river connectivity is a major contributor to these declines, as free migration routes between marine and freshwater habitats are crucial for life-history completion. For the conservation and ultimately recovery of such species, it is imperative that remedial measures aimed at increasing connectivity are effective. This study investigated the distribution patterns of ascending juvenile european eel (anguilla anguilla l.) In rivers in south-western sweden, with a focus on the effects of barriers and measures that aim to reduce the impact of barriers, i.e. Fish-passage solutions (fpss). Eel occurrence data were spatially and temporally integrated with the national databases of dams and fpss in a geographic information system (gis) environment to evaluate their effect on ascending eel distribution. The types of barriers assessed were: (i) dams with nature-like fishways; (ii) dams with eel ramps; (iii) dams with technical fishways; and (iv) dams without fpss. Dams fitted with eel ramps or technical fishways, as well as dams without fpss, produced a significant negative effect on the probability of eel occurrence upstream. This negative effect was not found for dams fitted with nature-like fishways, indicating that these solutions may function better than the other fps types in this study. The probability of eel occurrence decreased with distance from the sea and increased with area sampled, number of electrofishing runs, water temperature, and with the size of the bottom substrate. We suggest that future conservation strategies for improving the natural immigration of juvenile eels should include optimizing fps function (e.g. Placement and design), the continued maintenance of fpss, the construction of nature-like fishways, and preferably the removal of dams, which will also benefit the downstream migration of maturing eels as well as restoring other ecosystem services."

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."

Evidence from a long-term demographic study of a tropical newt,LAU ANTHONY;KARRAKER NANCY E;DUDGEON DAVID,2017,"Forest loss has been associated with reduced survival in many vertebrates, and previous research on amphibians has mostly focused on effects at early life stages. Paramesotriton hongkongensis is a tropical newt that breeds in streams but spends up to 10months per year in terrestrial habitats. Populations are threatened by habitat degradation and collection for the pet trade, but the cryptic terrestrial lifestyle of this newt has limited our understanding of its population ecology, which inhibits development of a species-specific conservation plan. We conducted an eight-year (2007-2014) mark-recapture study on four p. Hongkongensis populations in hong kong and used these data to evaluate relationships between forest cover, body size, and rainfall on survival and to estimate population sizes. Hong kong has been subjected to repeated historic territory-wide deforestation, and thus, we wanted to determine whether there was a link between forest extent as a proxy of habitat quality and newt demography. Annual survival was positively associated with forest cover within core habitat of all populations and negatively related to body size. Mean annual survival (similar to 60%) was similar to that of other stream-dwelling amphibians, but varied among years and declined substantially in 2012-2013, perhaps due to illegal collection. Despite the link between forest extent and survival, population sizes declined at the most forested site by 40% and increased by 104% and 134% at two others. Forest protection and consequential secondary succession during recent decades in hong kong may have been responsible for persistence of p. Hongkongensis populations."

This raises concerns about the migration of the beetle outbreak from non-intervention zones to adjacent managed forests. In this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of large-scale disturbances by intervention and non-intervention type of management in the tatra mountains (central europe). We collected a time series of landsat images from 2003 to 2014, and applied maximum likelihood classification to map the extent of forest, windthrow, clear-cuts, beetle outbreak and fire. Our classified maps achieved high overall accuracies: 0.93 +/- 0.03 <= oa <= 0.96 +/- 0.03. The extent of forest declined over the study period. We found higher rate of beetle induced tree mortality in non-intervention versus intervention zone. Within two growing seasons after the windthrow, beetle infestation occurred in close proximity to uncleared windthrow (<similar to 250 m), which suggest the positive effect of salvage logging (removal of windthrown trees) on lowering the risk of beetle outbreak. The two times higher sum of disturbances in intervention then in non-intervention zone indicated the limited impact of sanitation felling (removal of standing beetle infested trees) to reduce beetle population. However, sanitation felling highly contributed to the decline of the forest cover. Overall, our results document the dynamics of windthrow, bark beetle and clear-cuts by type of management, and limited impact of logging activities in reducing beetle outbreak in neighboring areas with intervention and non-intervention type of management.

The supply-side view of diving trips was tested and analysed over a 4-year period (2008-2011) in the choice of divers between natural and artificial reefs, as well as such reef attributes as reef depth, reef distance from the main pier in santa maria bay, and the year-season as well as combinations thereof. Data were also analysed to determine if the deployed reefs off sal island had a complementary or a substitute function. It was observed that the presence of artificial reefs created more dive users, but that divers who used these reefs were not deterred from diving at natural reefs. This resulted in a low-diversion effect (low substitutability). Thus, dive operators can offer additional options to divers (moderate to highly complementary). The distance to diving sites was the most influential factor in diving decisions (linear model results indicated 15 more divers at distances closer to santa maria bay than elsewhere). From the log-linear model the number of divers would be expected to change, the distance being the most influential factor (11.7 times higher at closer sites); reef type and depth were less influential (0.2 times fewer divers at artificial reefs; 2.3 times more divers in shallower waters). Also apparent was that the depth of the reef was fundamental in the diver niche allocation throughout the seasons."

Long-term spatial and temporal turnover data for amphibian species compositions within a region are essential for implementing effective conservation strategies and to design regional protected areas. The present study used a complete 5-year monitoring data series to compare the impacts of different human disturbances on amphibian diversity compositions of the daweishan mountains (dnnr) in tropical se yunnan, china. The major habitat disturbances occurring at lower elevations were tropical agricultural expansion with the continued disappearance of natural vegetation, and various new artificial habitats have emerged for colonization by amphibians, but tourism activities have arisen recently at mid-higher elevations accompanied by road construction, traffic, and artificial buildings. The data showed that, although the species assemblage of amphibians demonstrated a large difference between the lower and mid-higher elevations, the number of species and individuals were not significantly different regardless of whether the data collected were for the mature or larval stages. Environmental factors, including air and water temperatures, were the major factors regulating the diversity distribution of amphibian assemblages in the daweishan mountains. Different disturbances between lower and middle-higher elevations showed similar degree of impacts on the distributions of amphibian diversity. If specified for amphibian diversity conservation in the daweishan mountains in the present study, the importance of protecting existing tropical forest fragments in the lowlands and protection from additional human disturbances in the continuous evergreen broadleaf forest in the highlands are equally important.

To understand the status of the small mammal community around poyang lake, the lakeside farmland and beaches were surveyed in 2015 and 2016. The results showed the overall trap success was 10.12% on farmland and 5.47% on lake beaches, with five species of rodentia and one species of soricomorpha. The density of the small mammal was high, especially in rice fields. Apodemus agrarius and rattus losea were the dominant species, representing 49.59% and 47.68% of the species composition on farmland. The dominant species on the beach area were a. Agrarius (66.01%) and r. Losea (28.76%). The species abundance and diversity indexes of the small mammal community on beaches were similar to those on farmland. The widespread presence of a. Agrarius, r. Losea, and rattus norvegicus on the beaches indicates the farmland community had migrated to the beach area. In conclusion, it is important to elucidate the succession of the small mammal community inhabiting the lake beaches in downstream areas to quantify the impact of the tgp."

There is an urgent need for such knowledge because migratory animals, especially birds, are important for pathogen transmission and also particularly sensitive to environmental changes. Here we compare the nematode species richness and relative immune investment (via relative spleen size) of almost 200 migratory and non-migratory species within three diverse groups of birds (anseriformes, accipitriformes and turdidae) with worldwide distributions and varied ecology. Our results provide the first large-scale demonstration that migratory birds face greater challenge from macroparasites as they have significantly dissimilar nematode fauna and higher nematode species richness compared to non-migratory species. Even though birds with relatively large spleens had more nematode species, there was no difference in relative spleen size between migratory and non-migratory bird species. The physiological stress of migration can be exacerbated by the potential range of pathologies induced by their richer nematode communities, particularly in combination with environmental perturbations. Altered migration stemming from global changes can also have important consequences for nematode transmission. Synthesis most studies on parasites of migratory birds versus non-migratory birds focus upon blood parasites; here we compared the diversity of another important parasite group - nematodes (roundworms) in three orders of birds. We found for any given order, migratory species and species with proportionally larger spleens generally have a wider range of nematodes. It is unclear why migratory species harbour more nematode species. Global climate change is expected to influence both bird migration patterns and infectious diseases, which may increase host susceptibility to parasitism and also introduce diverse nematodes to new areas and potential hosts."

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

A multivariate analysis showed close relationships: the maritime traffic disturbance and the food quality and availability drive the spatial differences of the assemblages, dividing the area into three sub-areas: the area near the boate torrent that empties into the harbour, the harbour proper, and the external area (just outside the harbour). Macro- and meiofauna showed notably different temporal trends, indicating competition for the resources and the higher sensitivity of the macrofauna to environmental pressures. The macrofauna strongly decreased as a response to heavier harbour activities, with increasing turbidity also affecting the external station outside the harbour. Finally, comparing the macrofaunal communities to those sampled in the same area 10 years before, we found that their abundance, richness and biomass had notably decreased, highlighting the worsening of the harbour environment due to the increased organic load and turbidity.

The chinese market for high-valued animal products such as elephant ivory and pangolin scales has encouraged poaching, exploitation and trafficking of these goods in africa. Chinese demand for other african commodities, however, remains less well known. Using data across a 15-year period (2001-2015), we analysed the relationship between chinese timber imports and tree-cover loss in the congo basin. Tree-cover loss was measured via remote sensing and the value of imports was obtained from official trade statistics. Results indicate that the total accumulated export of wood from congo basin countries to china doubled between 2001 and 2015, with 50% of exports originating from cameroon and the republic of congo. We found a positive relationship between measures of chinese logging and the loss of tree cover in the congo basin. Further investigation of the timber products market showed that us demand for chinese-made furniture was positively correlated with chinese timber imports from the congo basin. These findings suggest that us demand for furniture encourages chinese economic actors to harvest timber from congo basin forests. Our results help to illuminate the complex environmental and economic drivers surrounding trade and deforestation and can help inform consumers about more sustainable ways to purchase wood products from one of the world's preeminent biodiversity hotspots."

It is a matter of intense debate whether the ecosystem is threatened by hunting practices, whereby an ""empty forest"" loses critical ecological functions. Strikingly, no previous study has examined amazonian ecosystem resilience through the perspective of the massive 20th century international trade in furs and skins. We present the first historical account of the scale and impacts of this trade and show that whereas aquatic species suffered basin-wide population collapse, terrestrial species did not. We link this differential resilience to the persistence of adequate spatial refuges for terrestrial species, enabling populations to be sustained through source-sink dynamics, contrasting with unremitting hunting pressure on more accessible aquatic habitats. Our findings attest the high vulnerability of aquatic fauna to unregulated hunting, particularly during years of severe drought. We propose that the relative resilience of terrestrial species suggests a marked opportunity for managing, rather than criminalizing, contemporary traditional subsistence hunting in amazonia, through both the engagement of local people in community-based comanagement programs and science-led conservation governance."

Eu trade data for t. Gigas was obtained from the unep-wcmcm cites trade database.

We observed a sudden shift in source codes (from wild-caught to captive-bred) coinciding with legislative changes, which has been indicative of laundering practices in the past. In the us, no less than 45% of all imported t. Gigas was declared as wild-caught, constituting a direct violation of indonesia's national laws and the us lacey act. The keeping of trade records is subjected to the willingness of individual countries, yet unwillingness to collect such data can severely threaten species when over-exploitation or laundering practices remain undetected.

This study investigated the effects of tourist usage of roads vs. Hiking trails on bird communities in gorges of the flinders ranges, a popular south australian tourist destination in the arid-lands. High tourist usage along roads decreased the individual abundance and species richness of birds relative to low usage trails. The decrease in species richness, though less pronounced, also occurred at high-usage sites along trails. Changes in the species response to recreational disturbance/impacts varied depending on the ecology of the species. Bigger, more competitive birds with a generalist diet were overrepresented at high-usage sites along roads and trails. Species using microhabitats in lower vegetation layers were more sensitive. However, structural and floristic complexity of vegetation was a more important factor influencing bird abundance than tourist usage. Sites with a better developed shrub and tree layer sustained higher species abundance and richer communities. Importantly, vegetation qualities moderated the negative effect of high usage on the individual abundance of birds along roads, to the extent that such an effect was absent at sites with the best developed shrub and tree layer. To protect avifauna along recreational tracks in arid-lands gorges, we recommend the closure of some gorges or sections for vehicle or any access. Further, open space particularly for camping needs to be minimized as it creates areas of high tourist usage with modified habitat that provides birds with little buffer from disturbance.

Critical loads are used to map sensitive regions and habitats, permit individual polluting activities, and frame international negotiations on transboundary air pollution. Despite their fundamental importance in environmental science and policy, there has been no systematic attempt to verify a critical load with field survey data. Here, we use a large dataset of european grasslands along a gradient of nitrogen (n) deposition to show statistically significant declines in the abundance of species from the lowest level of n deposition at which it is possible to identify a change. Approximately 60% of species change points occur at or below the range of the currently established critical load. If this result is found more widely, the underlying principle of no harm in pollution policy may need to be modified to one of informed decisions on how much harm is acceptable. Our results highlight the importance of protecting currently unpolluted areas from new pollution sources, because we cannot rule out ecological impacts from even relatively small increases in reactive n deposition."

Thirty-one endemic species were recorded, one of which is mindanao endemic. Three vulnerable species, gallicolumba criniger (mindanao bleeding-heart), alcedo argentata (silvery kingfisher) and ficedula basilanica (little slaty flycatcher) were recorded both in the young and mature plantations. The aethopyga primigenius (grey-hooded sunbird), a near threatened species was recorded in mature plantations only. The presence of these vulnerable species in all study sites indicates the need to protect the degraded secondary residual forest and forest patches along the plantation.

Although international and domestic trade regulations are in place, in 'exceptional circumstances' trade in asian big cats is legally permitted. More generally, and irrespective of its legal status, trade also has potential to compromise wild animal welfare. We report an apparent shift toward commercial trade in captive bred clouded leopards, trade irregularities that point toward possible laundering of wild caught animals, and document the presence of individuals on 'tiger farms' in south-east asia and a 'lion park' in south africa. We found cites records contradictory and incomplete, with data on source country particularly lacking. This study highlights 'legal loopholes' that apply to all asian big cat species. As a precautionary measure, we support calls to extend existing bans on asian big cat trade so that they include commercial trade in captive bred individuals. Illegal trade in derivatives can openly be observed online and at wildlife markets in range countries where enforcement is weak. However, an energetic search has revealed that specific information regarding clouded leopards is lacking. We argue that this is not grounds for complacency, but rather suggests a need for research into trade dynamics, cooperation between national enforcement agencies, improved compliance with trade data management systems, the destruction of private held stockpiles and the revision of existing legal frameworks to prevent illegal trade in these and other threatened wild felids."

However, an increasing number of reports have shown the presence and spread of non-native plants in antarctica; it is therefore important to study which factors control the invasion process in this ecosystem. Here, we assessed the role of different human activities on the presence and abundance of the invasive poa annua. In addition, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment in the field, and a manipulative experiment of germination with p. Annua and the natives colobanthus quitensis and deschampsia antarctica, in order to unravel the effects of physical soil disturbance on the establishment and survival of p. Annua. We found a positive correlation between abundance of p. Annua and level of soil disturbance, and that survival of p. Annua was 33% higher in sites with disturbed soil than non-disturbed. Finally, we found that disturbance conditions increased germination for p. Annua, whereas for native species germination in experimentally disturbed soil was either unchanged or reduced compared to undisturbed soil. Our results indicate that human activities that modify abiotic soil characteristics could play an important role in the abundance of this invasive species. If the current patterns of human activities are maintained in antarctica, the establishment success and spread of p. Annua could increase, negatively affecting native flora."

Assessment tools are an essential component in the planning process and identifying pressures and threats in protected areas will indicate priority actions for conservation. Therefore, national parks in a developed economy (usa) and an emerging economy (brazil) were studied. The objectives were to identify the main pressures and threats of national parks relative to different stages of economic development and to assess the effect of public use on biodiversity of national parks. We sampled five national parks in the state of rio de janeiro (brazil) and seven in the national capital region of the usa (four parks in the state of maryland, two parks in the state of virginia, and one park in washington, d.c.). Rapid assessment and prioritization of protected area management (rappam) methodology, developed by the world wildlife fund, was used in the study. The results indicated a variety of pressures and threats faced by national parks. In the usa increasing development of park surroundings and overabundant deer populations were major concerns. In brazil poaching and external influences were highlighted. Exotic species were of concern in both countries. In neither country did public use figure as a major threat or pressure. This observation suggests the possible increase in public use of national parks in brazil without compromising biodiversity conservation, thus enhancing economic development and increasing regional dynamism. To maintain biodiversity with increased economic development and public use, we believe the following are needed: (1) adequate park personnel, including staff to enforce rules and regulations; (2) adequate financial resources; and (3) capability to monitor and limit public use if necessary."

After a population collapse that reached its nadir in the 1970s, the guanaco lama guanicoe population in tierra del fuego, chile, recovered and is now in conflict with sheep ranching and commercial logging. We studied the effects of livestock density and environmental factors on guanaco abundance and spatial ecology, using seasonal counts and radio-telemetry in a private protected area (karukinka) and neighbouring ranches in a forest-grassland mosaic in tierra del fuego. Guanaco density was highest in low-elevation areas with more grassland cover and little snow accumulation in winter. In low-elevation areas, guanaco density decreased with increasing livestock density. Radio-tracked guanacos exhibited a partial migration pattern: two individuals migrated seasonally, selecting grasslands and avoiding forests mainly in summer, whereas six sedentary individuals used habitats according to their availability. Migratory guanacos spent the summer in karukinka and winter on nearby ranches. High sheep densities and poor range condition on the ranches reduce key forage resources available to guanacos and may promote use of forests by guanacos, affecting forest regeneration and increasing conflict with logging. Current guanaco harvest by loggers may fail to reduce the impact of guanacos on logged-forest regeneration if guanaco spatial ecology and sheep management are not considered. Our results provide insight into the interactions among guanacos, forests and livestock ranching, and may be used to reduce conflicts and guide conservation in the fuegian ecosystem."

Location global. Methods patterns of recorded species invasions and pathways of introduction were mapped and visualized using data from the global invasive species database (gisd) and the cabi invasive species compendium (cabi isc), along with associated legal instruments relevant to ias compiled from the ecolex database. A novel indicator of the asymmetry between each country's 'ingress/egress' of ias (kappa, k), was developed to further explore spatial patterns. Results substantial variation in the spatial patterns of invasion was determined, with the global north, some newly industrialized countries and small tropical islands being the main recipients of ias and asymmetry (k) being highest in new world countries and small islands. Of the 1517 recorded ias, 39% were introduced only intentionally and 26% only unintentionally, 22% both intentionally and unintentionally, while 13% had no information available. The dominant pathway for species invasions was horticulture and the nursery trade, with 31% of the species introduced outside of their natural geographical range. Large increases in legislation on ias have occurred since the 1990s, particularly for those countries that have high numbers of species invasions. Main conclusions clear global patterns in the distributions of ias are determined, supporting arguments emphasizing the role of colonial history, economic development and trade in driving the human-mediated movement of species. Dominant pathways for species invasions are similar across different regions. Policy responses towards ias show an increasing desire from the international community to act on species invasions. Current patterns suggest that africa and central asia are priority areas for future ias research and control."

Recent dam constructions on the yangtze river and its tributaries for agriculture and hydroelectric power exert strong effects on the hydrological regimes of this lake. However, few studies have investigated how the land-use changes through time affect the habitat suitability for wintering anseriformes-the largest community in this region. Thus, it is necessary to timely monitor changes in the habitat quality and understand the potential factors that alter it. In this study, three periods (1995, 2005 and 2014) of typical environmental indicators that have direct impacts on foraging and resting for the anserformes, including proximity to water (density of lakes, rivers and ponds), human disturbances (density of residences and various road networks), preferred land cover types and food availability (ndvi), are integrated to develop a habitat suitability index model for habitat mapping. The results indicate that long-term lake shrinkage in low-water periods led to greatly expanded wetlands in these years, which provided more suitable habitat for migratory waterfowl. The amount of highly suitable habitat in 2014 was nearly twice as much as in 1995. Recent survey data from 1997 to 2013 also revealed an increase in the population size, and confirmed the improvement of habitat suitability in the poyang lake region. Spatial analysis revealed that land use changes contributed most to the improved habitat coverage between 1995 and 2014. However, the relative significances of these transformations for highly suitable and moderately suitable habitats are strikingly different. Increases in wetland and paddy field area are the main reasons for explaining these improvements, respectively. The framework model proposed in this study will help governments to evaluate habitat conservation and restoration for protecting waterbirds in a spatially explicit way. (C) 2016 elsevier b.v.

Moreover, previous studies have shown it to be widely circulated in live-bird markets. However, how live-bird markets in addition to wild birds affect the local persistence of avian influenza virus (aiv) remains uncertain. The abundance of fresh water and widely distributed wetlands make the poyang lake area a suitable overwintering site for migratory birds. The intensive local poultry industry and poor biosecurity potentially increase the risk of interactions between the wild and domestic birds. These factors likely contributed to the spread and persistence of aivs in the poyang lake area in these years. Here, a cross-sectional survey together with sampling was conducted randomly in the poyang lake area to investigate the local distribution of the h5n1 viruses. In total, 891 poultry isolates from 31 villages around the poyang lake area were randomly sampled in poultry sectors and tested for the presence of avian influenza using rt-pcr assays. Environmental factors such as poultry density, road accessibility, and wild bird biodiversity together with breeding characteristics derived from these questionnaires were collected and utilized for risk analysis modelling. Our results revealed that distance to the nearest wetlands with a high number of birds and accessibility by road were the main risk factors for the occurrence hpaiv h5n1, suggesting that the high density of road networks may facilitate the transmission of this virus. Investigating the regional distribution characteristics of the virus is of great significance, therefore the general public would benefit from an early warning, prevention, and taking control measures in high-risk regions."

Nonetheless, these technologies are still under development, especially the leakage of the stored co2 and the consequent acidification of the environment. Therefore, the goal of this study is to test the impact of co2-induced acidification on a macrobenthic community due to leakages from cs-ssgs using a mesocosm-based experiment. Results confirmed the significant correlation between the abundance of the species and the ph (positively), and the alkalinity (negatively). Additionally, the bioenv analysis showed that the majority of the variability in the abundance of the total species was explained for the alkalinity. The correlation analysis showed differential vulnerabilities of different species, especially cyathura carinata and a non-calcifier species as hediste diversicolor. Nevertheless, these results showed the importance of taking into account the indirect effect associated with acidification processes, as metal release from sediment. (C) 2015 elsevier ltd.

However, roads can have a positive effect on local vascular plant species richness. Endemic species on oceanic islands are considered to be less disturbance-adapted than native non-endemics and thus should be negatively affected by roads. Islands provide optimal conditions for testing this, as they possess a large share of clearly defined endemic species. This study focuses on a comparison of endemic plant species in roadside and surrounding communities and the interacting effects of elevation, vegetation type and trade wind-induced precipitation differences. We applied 96 circular plots with 50 m radius along two elevational gradients on the eastern (humid) and western (dry) slope of la palma, canary islands, ranging from 100 to 2,400 m. Interestingly, we found roads to have a significant positive effect on endemic richness and the percentage of endemics as well as the same tendency for plant species richness after correcting for elevation and precipitation. Endemic species turnover was relatively high. The opening of cliffs during construction and, not to be overlooked, the protection from disturbances such as fire and omnipresent introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits or goats) probably leads to a positive effect of roads on endemics. In addition, many endemics might profit from species-specific dispersal capabilities well suited for roadside conditions. However, we do not argue for the use or even construction of roads for nature conservation but suggest protecting existing endemic populations because natural areas have a higher conservation value."

Knowledge of the habitat selection of migrating birds is important from both a conservation and agro-economic point of view. We investigated the habitat preferences of three common migrating goose species: white-fronted goose anser albifrons, bean goose a. Fabalis and greylag goose a. Anser during the autumn of 2009 in western poland. A total of 24 flocks of these species were identified. Geese preferred large, elevated fields that were remote from forests and human settlements but in close proximity to a lake. Geese selected maize stubbles and avoided winter cereals. They selected sites in landscapes with a lower diversity of crops. Flock size was negatively correlated with the proportion of pastures in the landscape, but it increased with field size, distance to forest and distance to town. Our results are in contrast with the paradigm that less intensive farmland positively influences habitat use by birds during foraging. We advise the delayed ploughing of stubbles with the aim of creating appropriate foraging habitats for geese and minimizing damage to cereal crops."

These banks are managed in perpetuity and used to mitigate impacts occurring elsewhere to the species' habitat. We developed a species crediting methodology to assess conservation credits and debits for the endangered oregon chub (oregonichthys crameri) to support conservation banking. Our methodology is based on prior studies assessing relationships between population abundance and habitat parameters for the species. The methodology also incorporates ratings for piscivory risk, site location, and the abundance and status of existing and proximal populations. Our approach assigns more credits to functioning bank sites that support abundant, stable populations and requires more credits when impacted sites negatively affect these populations. Examples show the credit value calculations for determining baseline conditions and for assessing impacts to species habitat. Additional examples illustrate the incentives for creating habitats that support abundant, stable populations and the incentives for reducing the severity and duration of impacts to habitats. As the demand for economic development of prime fish habitat increases and as more conservation banks are developed, managers may benefit by developing similar crediting methodologies to promote adequate compensatory conservation for imperiled species."

Habitat fragmentation, loss of biodiversity and vegetation changes are some of the most common impacts of urbanisation. In many indian cities, the urban core is characterised by historical human settlements with narrow lanes and packed commercial establishments, while urbanisation that occurred after 1970s preferred spacing between the dwellings with more greenery or urban forestry. As urbanisation progresses, the urban fringes have more scope for incorporating environmental concerns and conservation. In this study, we measured species richness and abundance of birds within varied urban habitats and landscapes along the urban-rural gradient in tiruchirappalli, india. We also tried to determine the linkage between bird diversity and landscape attributes including anthropogenic factors. Our observations showed that within urban areas, certain landscapes favoured species richness while many habitats are unfriendly for species but encouraged homogenisation. As we move from urban core towards rural gradient, the species richness increased; however, it is not uniform in all peripheral directions. Interestingly, the urban fringes at certain pockets had richness equivalent to rural locations. Species richness positively correlated with vegetation cover while built cover, noise, vehicular movement and pedestrians had negative impacts. As the urban fringes are in various stages of development, they have more scope for integrating ecological and biodiversity considerations and in this aspect wetlands, riverine farmlands and urban forests may play a crucial role in retaining native birds and also supporting migratory bird species."

Methods we built a database combining range area, seven ecological traits, and a molecular phylogeny for native canadian freshwater fishes. We tested latitudinal and longitudinal patterns in grs by the mean of pearson correlations. We combined phylogenetic generalized least squares (pgls) models and a model selection procedure to tease apart hypotheses (and hence ecological traits) that best explained grs in our dataset. Pglss were also used to explore relationships between ecological traits, phylogeny, and species mid-range latitude and longitude. Partial regressions were used to determine direct and indirect relationships driving spatial patterns of grs in canadian freshwater fishes. Results there was a significant and positive correlation between grs, latitude and longitude. According to pglss, three ecological traits, related to the habitat use, migratory and thermal tolerance hypotheses, were significantly correlated with grs, mid-range longitude and mid-range latitude. Two traits related to locomotion were further related to grs. There was no phylogenetic effect on grs (i.e. No phylogenetic conservatism). Partial regressions revealed complex direct and indirect relationships between ecological traits, mid-range latitude, mid-range longitude and grs. Main conclusions our results show that traits related to the ability to use dispersal corridors, as well as traits directly related to mobility, are useful in understanding biodiversity patterns such as rapoport's rule. However, because of a weak explanatory power, we conclude that using biological proxies of grs to predict species at risk of extinction would be premature."

Highly disturbed areas such as surface-mined land provide a great challenge for ecological restoration. The goal is to identify appropriate restoration approaches in a continuum between technical reclamation and spontaneous succession. In particular, on slopes endangered by erosion, appropriate methods are needed that quickly establish vegetation cover but also take into account the natural potentials of the site. 2. In the mined area rossbach (saxony-anhalt, germany), we evaluated the effects of spontaneous succession and assisted site recovery (species introduction through hay transfer and sowing) during a 9-year experiment. We asked how rates and pathways of vegetation development differ between treatments and whether species composition converges over time owing to species exchange. 3. The application of green hay as well as the sowing of regional seed mixtures clearly accelerated vegetation development and led to the rapid establishment of species-rich grasslands. Hay transfer was most successful owing to the high amount of transferable target species. Moreover, both treatments facilitated the establishment of cryptogams and provided effective erosion control. Also, hay transfer and sowing clearly affected the pathway of succession. Calamagrostis epigejos migrated from nearby source populations and became increasingly dominant at sites with spontaneous succession. In contrast, the species-rich grasslands established after hay transfer and sowing were highly resistant to invasion of calamagrostis and other ruderals. 4. Species exchange between treatments led to increasing similarity in vegetation composition over time. Nine years after implementation of the experiment, we did not find any significant differences between treatments in terms of total vegetation cover, species richness and the number of target species. However, the dominance ratio between target and nontarget species differed significantly. Species introduction through hay transfer and sowing led to a permanently higher abundance of grassland species and a lower coverage of ruderals compared with spontaneously developed sites. Hence, our results highlight the importance of initial floristic composition and the order of species arrivals for long-termvegetation development. 5. Synthesis and applications. Hay transfer and sowing of regional seed mixtures are appropriate restoration tools to achieve rapid revegetation when no potential seed sources of target species are available nearby or there are undesirable species that need to be suppressed. Our results show that introduced grassland species are able to grow under postmining site conditions and can migrate into adjacent spontaneously developing sites. A combination of spontaneous and assisted site recovery can promote the development of species-rich grasslands in postmining landscapes."

While this expansion threatens a smaller arctic ecological equivalent, the arctic fox (vulpes lagopus), the case became a textbook example of climate-driven range shifts. We tested this classical climate change hypothesis linked to an important range shift which has attracted little research thus far. We analysed canadian fur harvest data from the hudson's bay company archives (14 trading posts; 1926-1950), testing hypotheses based on changes in summer and winter climates. Summer warming might have triggered a bottom-up increase in ecosystem productivity, while winter warming might have lowered thermal stress, both favouring red fox expansion. Additionally, we evaluated the hypothesis that red fox expansion was driven by the appearance of human sedentary sites (n = 110) likely bringing food subsidies into the unproductive tundra. Analysis of red fox expansion chronologies showed that expansion speed was higher during warmer winters. However, the expansions occurred under both cooling and warming trends, being faster during cooler summers in the baffin island region. The increasing proportion of red fox in fox fur harvests was best explained by human activity, while generalized linear mixed models also revealed a marginal effect of warmer winters. Generalized additive models confirmed human presence as the most important factor explaining rates of change in the proportion of red fox in fox fur harvests. Using historical ecology, we disentangled the relative influences of climate change and anthropogenic habitat change, two global drivers that transformed arctic biodiversity during the last century and will likely continue to do so during this century. Anthropogenic food subsidies, which constitute stable food sources, facilitated the invasion of the tundra biome by a new mammalian predator and competitor, with long-term consequences that still remain to be understood."

Biomonitoring of the disturbed area and a control station shows that elevated temperature is a more significant stressor compared to salinity, thus causing a decrease in abundance and richness. Critical temperature thresholds were observed at 30 and 35 degrees c, the latter representing the most thermally tolerant species in the studied area pararotalia calcariformata, which is the only symbiont-bearing species observed within the core of the heated area.

There is considerable debate about mesopredator release and the role that other potential factors such as landscape variables and human alterations to land cover lead to increased mesopredator abundance. We used camera traps to detect four mesopredators (tayra, eira barbara; white-nosed coati, nasua narica; northern raccoon, procyon lotor; and common opossum, didelphis opossum) in a biological corridor in costa rica to estimate habitat covariates that influenced the species' detection and occurrence. We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes. Furthermore, fragmentation and land cover changes may predispose nesting birds, herpetofauna, and small mammals to heightened predation risk by mesopredators in the neotropics."

Natural savannas in south america have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos. In particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion towards already degraded lands (e.g. Improved grassland areas currently used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas are spared."
619,6,15,Yuqian,not vetted,1740,Environmental variability indicates a climate-adaptive center under threat in northern mozambique coral reefs,MCCLANAHAN TIMOTHY R;MUTHIGA NYAWIRA A,2017,"A priority for modern conservation is finding and managing regions with environmental and biodiversity portfolio characteristics that will promote adaptation and the persistence of species during times of rapid climate change. The latitudinal edges of high-diversity biomes are likely to provide a mixture of environmental gradients and biological diversity that meet the portfolio criteria needed for adaptive systems. Northern mozambique and the quirimbas islands represent the edge of a coral reef diversity center with limited potential to expand because of geologic and oceanographic limits on the southern edges. This region does, however, have the potential to be its own discrete adaptive center if it contains climate refugia and there are environmental gradients that promote acclimatization, ecological reorganization, and natural selection. Consequently, to evaluate this potential we tested for strong regional environmental spatial heterogeneity that might indicate a climate-adaptive center. Additionally, we evaluated human influences and environmental and demographic data on finfish, coral, and sea urchins in 66 reefs across similar to 4 degrees of latitude to evaluate ecological changes and human threats. A number of clear gradients in environmental and human influences were observed. For example, temperature increased and became more centralized and right-skewed, while water quality decreased to the south. Coral communities susceptible to thermal stress were found in the north where dispersed temperatures indicated a location with either tolerance to or refugium from recent thermal disturbances. Nevertheless, high coral diversity was found in southern deep-water channels. Further, spatial patterns for corals and fish differed indicating complex geographic-fishing-biodiversity gradients. Consequently, environmental conditions for an adaptive portfolio exist and include refugia for preserving climate-sensitive and for numbers of coral taxa. Fishing and urban threats were observable as reduced fish biomass, diversity, and body sizes but higher biomass of sea urchins. We observed that many remote and protected areas had fish biomass values lower than expected or near maximum sustainable yields. This indicates low compliance and widespread migratory fishing, which is reducing fish diversity below maximum levels. Recommendations to sustain this adaptive center are to maintain fish biomass >500 kg/ha by increasing fisheries restrictions and compliance."

Singing males of scops owl were censused over a 27-year period (1981-2007) on oleron, an island under heavy pressure of urbanization and tourism. Habitats used by the species were inferred from the location of singing individuals. Variation in their numbers was analyzed as a function of the structure of the male's home range. The present analysis is based on a previous study in abundance and distribution of singing males and on an accurate mapping of the available habitats over the island. On oleron 80% of singing males were contacted in wooded areas. By modelling the effect of habitat traits we showed that the density of singing males was positively influenced by the importance of wooded areas and negatively influenced by urbanized areas. This situation is in contrast with what has been described elsewhere for the scops owl, particularly in the mediterranean region where this species is much more linked to urbanized areas. The occurrence in wooded areas on oleron may both reflect insect abundance and severe reduction in cultivated areas."

Population genetic studies of invasive species can provide key insights into their invasion history and ensuing evolution, but also for their control. Here we genetically characterise populations of impatiens glandulifera, an invasive plant in europe that can have a major impact on native plant communities. We compared populations from the species' native range in kashmir, india, to those in its invaded range, along a latitudinal gradient in europe. For comparison, the results from 39 other studies of genetic diversity in invasive species were collated. Results: our results suggest that i. Glandulifera was established in the wild in europe at least twice, from an area outside of our kashmir study area. Our results further revealed that the genetic diversity in invasive populations of i. Glandulifera is unusually low compared to native populations, in particular when compared to other invasive species. Genetic drift rather than mutation seems to have played a role in differentiating populations in europe. We find evidence of limitations to local gene flow after introduction to europe, but somewhat less restrictions in the native range. I. Glandulifera populations with significant inbreeding were only found in the species' native range and invasive species in general showed no increase in inbreeding upon leaving their native ranges. In europe we detect cases of migration between distantly located populations. Human activities therefore seem to, at least partially, have facilitated not only introductions, but also further spread of i. Glandulifera across europe. Conclusions: although multiple introductions will facilitate the retention of genetic diversity in invasive ranges, widespread invasive species can remain genetically relatively invariant also after multiple introductions. Phenotypic plasticity may therefore be an important component of the successful spread of impatiens glandulifera across europe."

Specific human pressures over recent decades, such as expanding human populations, urbanization, and forest fragmentation, may have altered the ecological niche of pteropus species acting as natural hev reservoirs and may modulate spillover risk. This study explored the influence of inter-decadal net human local migration between 1970 and 2000 on changes in the habitat suitability to p. Alecto and p. Conspicillatus from 1980 to 2015 in eastern australia. These ecological niches were modeled using boosted regression trees and subsequently fitted, along with additional landscape factors, to hev spillovers to explore the spatial dependency of this zoonosis. The spatial model showed that the ecological niche of these two flying fox species, the human footprint, and proximity to woody savanna were each strongly associated with hev spillover and together explained most of the spatial dependency exhibited by this zoonosis. These findings reinforce the potential for anthropogenic pressures to shape the landscape epidemiology of hev spillover."

We evaluated the effects of various external factors on the population numerical abundance of curimba prochilodus lineatus in the upper parana river floodplain, brazil, over a 19-year period. Panel data analysis was applied to examine the structure of temporal and spatial abundance while controlling auto-regressive processes and spatial non-homogeneity variances that often obscure relationships. As sources of population variation, we considered predation, competition, selected abiotic variables, construction of a dam upstream of the study area, water level and flood intensity during the spawning period. We found that biological interactions (predation and competition) were not significantly related to variations in curimba abundance; specific conductance was a space indicator of abundance, apparently linked to the biology of the species; intensity of floods determined inter-annual variation in abundances; porto primavera dam negatively impacted the abundances at sites in the floodplain directly affected by discharges from the dam. Panel data analysis was a powerful tool that identified the need for intense flooding to maintain high abundances of curimba in the upper parana river. We believe our results apply to other species with similar life strategy."

The abundance of farmland birds is one important element of this biodiversity. At the end of the 20th century, member states of the european union (eu) experienced serious population declines of farmland birds due to agricultural intensification, which was not observed in the eastern european nonmember states. In 2004, 10 mostly eastern european countries acceded to the eu. It is thus important to ask whether this historical step resulted in changes of agricultural production and, in turn, in farmland bird populations. Here we used annual crop yields and monitoring data on farmland bird abundance in an eastern european new eu-member state and showed that agricultural production intensified and farmland bird populations declined steeply after country's eu accession. These results indicate that entering eu's common agricultural policy caused significant deterioration of farmland biodiversity in a once biodiversity-rich region."

Here, the implications of using different indicators in the calculation of biodiversity footprints caused by land use were analyzed. Footprints refer to the impacts related to the net consumption in a region. We calculated biodiversity footprints for 140 regions in the world with an environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output (eemrio) model. The eemrio links economic activities from the global trade analysis project (gtap) database with land use and four indicators of biodiversity loss. We included three alpha diversity indicators (loss of mean species abundance, relative abundance and relative species richness) and one indicator of gamma diversity (vulnerability-weighted relative species richness loss). While the three alpha diversity indicators reflect local diversity within a site, the gamma diversity indicator captures global diversity by weighting regional species richness with species' extinction vulnerability in a region. We found that the three alpha diversity footprints show close alignment (r(s) > 0.93), while there was limited convergence between alpha and gamma diversity footprints (r(s) < 0.22). The alpha diversity indicators identified a diverse set of regions with high per capita consumption-based biodiversity footprints across the globe, while the gamma diversity indicator emphasized human consumption patterns threatening particularly tropical biodiversity. Although all footprints are positively related to rising household expenditure, this relationship was weaker and highly uncertain for the gamma diversity footprints. The alpha-based footprints also showed a negative relationship with population density, while the gamma-based footprint was not related to population density. Our results highlight the relevance of including both alpha and gamma diversity indicators in land-based biodiversity footprint calculations."

Such activities may accidentally lead to oil spills in partly ice-covered ocean areas, which raises issues related to oil spill response. Net environmental benefit analysis (neba) is the process that the response community uses to identify which combination of response strategies minimises the impact to environment and people. The vulnerability of valued ecosystem components (vec's) to oil pollution depends on their sensitivity to oil and the likelihood that they will be exposed to oil. As such, neba requires a good ecological knowledge base on biodiversity, species' distributions in time and space, and timing of ecological events. Biological resources found at interfaces (e.g., air/water, ice/water or water/coastline) are in general vulnerable because that is where oil can accumulate. Here, we summarize recent information about the seasonal, physical and ecological processes in arctic waters and evaluate the importance these processes when considering in oil spill response decision making through neba. In springtime, many boreal species conduct a lateral migration northwards in response to sea ice retraction and increased production associated with the spring bloom. However, many arctic species, including fish, seabirds and marine mammals, are present in upper water layers in the arctic throughout the year, and recent research has demonstrated that bioactivity during the arctic winter is higher than previously assumed. Information on the seasonal presence/absence of less resilient vec's such as marine mammals and sea birds in combination with the presence/absence of sea ice seems to be especially crucial to consider in a neba. In addition, quantification of the potential impact of different, realistic spill sizes on the energy cascade following the spring bloom at the ice edge would provide important information for assessing ecosystem effects."

We focus on the trade in tortoises and freshwater turtles for pets in one of southeast asia's largest wildlife trading centres, the chatuchak market in bangkok, thailand. Between november 2004 and december 2013 we surveyed chatuchak 12 times, recording all species and quantities of tortoises and freshwater turtles openly for sale. In total, 2,667 individuals representing 55 species, were observed with 97 % of the individuals belonging to species not native to thailand. African, south asian and southeast asian species made up the largest numbers. The number of individuals recorded per survey ranged between 110 and 522 of between 11 and 24 species; species richness, species diversity and evenness did not show any clear temporal pattern. New species were added after new surveys suggesting a continual increasing supply of novel species. The most common species in trade over this period were indian star tortoise geochelone elegans (653 individuals), african spurred tortoise g. Sulcata (536) and radiated tortoise astrochelys radiata (320). Globally threatened species were observed during every survey, totalling 1,235 individuals of 20 species. These included critically endangered radiated tortoises and burmese star tortoise g. Platynota. Non-native cites i listed species, i.e. Species that should not be traded internationally, such as black spotted turtle geoclemys hamiltonii from northeastern india and bangladesh, were observed during all but one surveys, totalling 417 individuals of seven species. The observations of large numbers of species that had clearly entered the country illegally was clear evidence that unscrupulous traders are taking advantage of the loopholes in thailand's legislation. Legal reform in thailand is urgently required, so that the wild animal reservation and protection act can function as an effective piece of legislation to be used to bring an end to the illegal trade in tortoises and freshwater turtles in thailand."

To acquire the aim of the article, the sampling area was selected under the condition that the ecotourism is solely the variable factor and the slope, direction and height are considered constant factor after evaluation of the ecological land unit drawings. Two zones of high pressured and low pressured ecotourism were considered after evaluation of related drawings. Samples were taken in spring 2010. For evaluation of the plant biodiversity 60 samples of 1 m2 (30 samples in each zone) were taken randomly and then the list of flora and the cover percentage of vegetation were recorded and then the percentage of vegetation data were analyzed in biopast software and the biodiversity (shanon, simpson) richness (menhinick, margalef) evenness (dominance, bergerparker,) and dominance (evenness, equitability) indices were calculated. The mentioned indices were inserted in spss ii software and the data normality was tested through kolomogrov-smirnov test.

However, in the bangladesh portion of the sundarbans (similar to 6,000 km(2)) tigers appear to have declined. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of a range of environmental and landscape variables in possible changes in the relative abundance of tigers in the bangladesh sundarbans over a five-year period (2007-2011). In 2007, 2011 tiger relative abundance was assessed using sign surveys. Using regression models we investigated changes in relative abundance versus multiple landscape variables (human disturbance associated with villages and commercial shipping lanes, distance to the international border with india where there is enhanced patrolling, presence of forest guard stations, number of criminal prosecutions and forest protection status). Tiger relative abundance was higher in 2007 and declined by 2011 with changes best explained by the proximity to international boundaries. This result might have been affected by the high levels of security patrols at the india-bangladesh border along with cross border tiger movement between india and bangladesh. Neighboring tiger range countries could strengthen cross-border law enforcement, increasing protection of dispersing animals. Particularly alarming was the absence of a positive effect of protected areas relative to those outside the protected area system or forest guard stations, implying a lack of management effectiveness suggesting an urgent need for an improved strategy for managing tigers and their habitats.

However, our knowledge about these transfers is limited. Historic data are essential tools to trace back human-mediated gene flow and for interpretation of recent genetic studies. Context human-mediated gene flow can potentially have a major impact on the genetic composition of forest tree populations, yet our knowledge about seed sources used within the current species' range is still limited. Norway spruce is one of the most important coniferous species in european forestry, and data drawing conclusions about the genetic composition of current populations are vital with regard to gene conservation and sustainable forest management. Because molecular data are not available on a more detailed scale, historic records provide crucial information about translocations. Aims our aim is to provide the first pan-european review on norway spruce translocations from the seventeenth until the twentieth century. Methods we analysed historic and recent literature compiling information on the cultivation and transfer of norway spruce reproductive material. Historic records are compared with recent molecular studies. Results seed exchanges have profoundly altered the native genetic population structure of norway spruce. Especially, central european seeds have been used throughout and beyond the natural distribution area. Figures illustrating the historic plantings in europe are provided. Conclusion recent molecular data reveal persisting effects of past translocations. Historical records can be extremely useful for providing information about autochthony and thus guide gene conservation strategies and explain the performance of extant populations."

Biologists and managers therefore must determine the best way to shepherd small populations through the dual challenges of reductions in both the number of individuals and genetic variability. By bringing in additional individuals, threatened populations can be increased in size (demographic rescue) or provided with variation to facilitate adaptation and reduce inbreeding (genetic rescue). The relative strengths of demographic and genetic rescue for reducing extinction and increasing growth of threatened populations are untested, and which type of rescue is effective may vary with population size. Using the flour beetle (tribolium castaneum) in a microcosm experiment, we disentangled the genetic and demographic components of rescue, and compared them with adaptation from standing genetic variation (evolutionary rescue in the strictest sense) using 244 experimental populations founded at either a smaller (50 individuals) or larger (150 individuals) size. Both types of rescue reduced extinction, and those effects were additive. Over the course of six generations, genetic rescue increased population sizes and intrinsic fitness substantially. Both large and small populations showed evidence of being able to adapt from standing genetic variation. Our results support the practice of genetic rescue in facilitating adaptation and reducing inbreeding depression, and suggest that demographic rescue alone may suffice in larger populations even if only moderately inbred individuals are available for addition."

We tested the effects of low ph and high temperature at levels predicted for 2100 on an ecologically important predator-prey system (sea stars, asterias rubens, and mussels, mytilus edulis) from the nw atlantic coast. Mussels are dominant competitors for space and important ecosystem engineers, while sea stars control mussel populations and thus local community structure. We found sea stars to be negatively affected in growth rate by low ph, with growth further reduced by a high temperature. In contrast, mussel growth rate was positively affected by low ph, with no response to temperature within the tested range. Predation of sea stars on mussels, measured as per-capita consumption rate, decreased in acidified conditions by 50%. Our study suggests that mussels may not be negatively affected by ph at the levels predicted for the end of this century and that mussels may be subjected to a reduced predation from sea stars under future conditions."

Climatic impacts have been suggested to occur at all levels of the barents sea food-web, but adequate exploration of these phenomena on ecologically relevant spatial scales has not been integrated sufficiently. We used a time-series of euphausiid abundance data spanning 58 years, one of the longest biological time-series in the arctic, to explore qualitative and quantitative relationships among climate, euphausiids, and their predators, and how these parameters vary spatially in the barents sea. We detected four main hydrographic regions, each with distinct patterns of interannual variability in euphausiid abundance and community structure. Assemblages varied primarily in the relative abundance of thysanoessa inermis vs. T raschii, or t inermis vs. T. Longicaudata, and meganyctiphanes norvegica. Climate proxies and the abundance of capelin or cod explained 30-60% of the variability in euphausiid abundance in each region. Climate also influenced patterns of variability in euphausiid community structure, but correlations were generally weaker. Advection of boreal euphausiid taxa from the norwegian sea is clearly more prominent in warmer years than in colder years, and interacts with seasonal fish migrations to help explain spatial differences in primary drivers of euphausiid community structure. Non-linear effects of predators were common, and must be considered more carefully if a mechanistic understanding of the ecosystem is to be achieved. Quantitative relationships among euphausiid abundance, climate proxies, and predator stock-sizes derived from these time series are valuable for ecological models being used to predict impacts of climate change on the barents sea ecosystem, and how the system should be managed."

Species richness and cover in both surveys generally increased with distance from the trail, but there were differences between the windward and leeward sides of the trail. This included increased abundance of some species but continued disruption of shrub succession on the leeward side of the trail. There was an overall increase in species richness between the two surveys, and changes in the abundance of many species independent of trampling effects, possibly reflecting the more favourable/wetter conditions for plant growth in 2013. These results suggest that changes in climatic conditions can affect community composition, but that this has not negated the impact of the hiking trail on this rare community. With average temperatures increasing, and snow cover declining in the australian alps, it is likely that there will be even more changes in the windswept feldmark, including the potential colonisation of these ridges by more competitive species, such as graminoids, at the expense of the dominant shrub and some herbs that are already adversely affected by trampling. Longer term monitoring of this rare community is imperative to better understand community processes in relation to the impacts of trail use and climate change. Management options to reduce these impacts are discussed."

Potential arenas of influence include altered evolutionary trajectories within populations and modifications of the process of divergence among populations. We consider this second arena in the medium ground finch (geospiza fortis) on santa cruz island, galapagos, ecuador. Our study compared the g. Fortis population at a relatively undisturbed site, el garrapatero, to the population at a severely disturbed site, academy bay, which is immediately adjacent to the town of puerto ayora. The el garrapatero population currently shows beak size bimodality that is tied to assortative mating and disruptive selection, whereas the academy bay population was historically bimodal but has lost this property in conjunction with a dramatic increase in local human population density. We here evaluate potential ecological-adaptive drivers of the differences in modality by quantifying relationships between morphology (beak and head dimensions), functional performance (bite force), and environmental characteristics (diet). Our main finding is that associations among these variables are generally weaker at academy bay than at el garrapatero, possibly because novel foods are used at the former site irrespective of individual morphology and performance. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rugged adaptive landscapes promoting and maintaining diversification in nature can be smoothed by human activities, thus hindering ongoing adaptive radiation."

However, the impacts of sand mining on the water body's habitat and biodiversity are not yet considered in the country. In this paper, we study how sand mining activities at lake tana and its inflowing rivers affect the environment and spawning grounds of the endemic labeobarbus species. We measured physico-chemical parameters in-situ and developed structured questionnaires to collect primary data on the fishery and sand mining. We found significant differences in conductivity, total dissolved solids and temperature among sampling sites (p<0.05). Majority (>90 per cent) of the respondents confirmed the drastic physical changes in the rivers and a severe decline in fish production. The study revealed that the ecology of the mined rivers was seriously affected by sand mining, which interfered with migratory routes of fishes and resulted in loss of their spawning grounds. The unregulated sand mining also conflicted with the interests of the fisheries management and environment. Thus, urgent policy intervention is needed to protect the ever-declining labeobarbus species of lake tana and the environment."

While the wildlife trade may put additional stress on coral reefs, it brings income into impoverished parts of the world and may stimulate interest in marine conservation. To better understand the influence of the trade, we must first be able to quantify coral reef fauna moving through it. Herein, we discuss the lack of a data system for monitoring the wildlife aquarium trade and analyze problems that arise when trying to monitor the trade using a system not specifically designed for this purpose. To do this, we examined an entire year of import records of marine tropical fish entering the united states in detail, and discuss the relationship between trade volume, biodiversity and introduction of non-native marine fishes. Our analyses showed that biodiversity levels are higher than previous estimates. Additionally, more than half of government importation forms have numerical or other reporting discrepancies resulting in the overestimation of trade volumes by 27%. While some commonly imported species have been introduced into the coastal waters of the usa (as expected), we also found that some uncommon species in the trade have also been introduced. This is the first study of aquarium trade imports to compare commercial invoices to government forms and provides a means to, routinely and in real time, examine the biodiversity of the trade in coral reef wildlife species."
654,41,519,Yuqian,not vetted,474,Evaluating herbivore management outcomes and associated vegetation impacts,GRANT RINA C C;PEEL MIKE J S;BEZUIDENHOUT HUGO,2011,"African savannas are characterised by temporal and spatial fluxes that are linked to fluxes in herbivore populations and vegetation structure and composition. We need to be concerned about these fluxes only when management actions cause the system to shift towards a less desired state. Large herbivores are a key attribute of african savannas and are important for tourism and biodiversity. Large protected areas such as the kruger national park (knp) manage for high biodiversity as the desired state, whilst private protected areas, such as those adjacent to the knp, generally manage for high income. Biodiversity, sustainability and economic indicators are thus required to flag thresholds of potential concern (tpcs) that may result in a particular set of objectives not being achieved. In large conservation areas such as the knp, vegetation changes that result from herbivore impact, or lack thereof, affect biodiversity and tpcs are used to indicate unacceptable change leading to a possible loss of biodiversity; in private protected areas the loss of large herbivores is seen as an important indicator of economic loss. Therefore, the first-level indicators aim to evaluate the forage available to sustain grazers without deleteriously affecting the vegetation composition, structure and basal cover. Various approaches to monitoring for these indicators were considered and the importance of the selection of sites that are representative of the intensity of herbivore use is emphasised. The most crucial step in the adaptive management process is the feedback of information to inform management decisions and enable learning. Feedback loops tend to be more efficient where the organisation's vision is focused on, for example, economic gain, than in larger protected areas, such as the knp, where the vision to conserve biodiversity is broader and more complex. Conservation implications: in rangeland, optimising herbivore numbers to achieve the management objectives without causing unacceptable or irreversible change in the vegetation is challenging. This manuscript explores different avenues to evaluate herbivore impact and the outcomes of management approaches that may affect vegetation."

Sand dune communities are worldwide characterized by high levels of biodiversity, but are often affected by human-induced impacts as those caused by tourist trampling. To understand the effects of human frequentation, trampling, and other human-induced impacts, fencing experiments have been traditionally carried out on coastal dunes. Since in touristic areas dune systems are subjected to different intensities of human frequentations rather than to opening or fencing, in this study we explore the effects of accessibility on vascular plants cover. This study tests the hypothesis that human frequentation on beaches affects spatio-temporal variability of vascular plant abundance on dunes by comparing the plant assemblages of high and low accessible sites in north-east sardinia (italy). Our results show that accessibility plays a crucial role in conditioning the percentage of vegetation cover in mediterranean dunes. In fact, not only we found a perennial vegetation cover that was significantly higher in the sites with low accessibility (and consequently low frequentation), but we also showed that at the sites with high accessibility there were significant differences in vegetation cover between times of sampling (cover was higher before than after summer): on the contrary, differences in perennial vegetation cover among times were not significant at the low frequentation sites. After summer, the difference among low and high frequentation sites in species composition and cover was >90%. Multivariate analysis identified those species that play a pivotal role in differentiating the low and the high frequentation sites. Among them, crucianella maritima and sporobolus virginicus can be considered as differential species. Overall, our data show vegetation and plant species responses to human-induced impacts, and are therefore important to support conservation actions in mediterranean coastal areas interested by mass tourism."

Flow dynamics is a major determinant of riparian plant communities. Therefore, flow regulation may heavily affect riparian ecosystems. Despite the large number of dams worldwide, little specific information is available on the longitudinal impacts of dams on vegetation, for example how far downstream and at what degree of regulation a dam on a river can influence riparian woodlands. 2. We quantified the long-term responses of riparian trees and shrubs to flow regulation by identifying their lateral distribution and habitat conditions along a boreal river in northern sweden that has been regulated by a single dam since 1948. The regulation has reduced annual flow fluctuations, this effect being largest at the dam, downstream from which it progressively decreases following the entrance of free-flowing tributaries. 3. We related changes in the distribution patterns, composition, abundance and richness of tree and shrub species to the degree of regulation along the river downstream from the dam. Regulation has triggered establishment of trees and shrubs closer to the channel, making it possible to measure ecological impacts of flow regulation as differences in vegetation attributes relative to the positions of tree and shrub communities established before and after regulation. 4. Trees and shrubs had migrated towards the mid-channel along the entire study reach, but the changes were largest immediately downstream of the dam. Shrubs were most impacted by flow regulation in terms of lateral movement, but the effect on trees extended furthest downstream. 5. The species composition of trees progressively returned to its pre-regulation state with distance downstream, but entrance of free-flowing tributaries and variation in channel morphology and substratum caused local deviations. Species richness after regulation increased for trees but decreased for shrubs. The changes in species composition and richness of trees and shrubs showed no clear downstream patterns, suggesting that other factors than the degree of regulation were more important in governing life form."

For a range of iucn-redlisted terrestrial and marine bird and mammal species worldwide, we use population viability analyses to calculate the net effects of ecotourism on expected time to extinction, in the presence of other anthropogenic threats such as poaching, primary industries and habitat loss. Species for which these calculations are currently possible, for one or more subpopulations, include: orangutan, hoolock gibbon, golden lion tamarin, cheetah, african wild dog, new zealand sealion, great green macaw, egyptian vulture, and african penguin. For some but not all of these species, tourism can extend expected survival time, i.e., benefits outweigh impacts. Precise outcomes depend strongly on population parameters and starting sizes, predation, and ecotourism scale and mechanisms. Tourism does not currently overcome other major conservation threats associated with natural resource extractive industries. Similar calculations for other threatened species are currently limited by lack of basic population data."

'HIGH NATIVE DIVERSITY', IS SUPPORTED BY THE REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES IN THE HIMALAYAS, NEPAL. THIS STUDY IS BASED ON DATA RETRIEVED FROM PUBLISHED LITERATURES AND HERBARIUM SPECIMENS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS AND THAT OF NATIVE PLANT SPECIES IS ELUCIDATED BY SCATTER PLOTS, AS WELL AS BY GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS. THE NATIVE PLANT SPECIES AND INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES HAVE SIMILAR DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES IS FOUND IN THE SAME ALTITUDINAL RANGE WHERE THE HIGHEST RICHNESS FOR NATIVE TREE SPECIES IS FOUND. THERE IS A CLEAR TREND OF HIGHER INVASIVE PLANT RICHNESS IN REGIONS WHERE NATIVE TREE SPECIES RICHNESS IS RELATIVELY HIGH. CONSEQUENTLY, THE NATIVE PLANT RICHNESS IS HIGHEST IN THE CENTRAL PHYTOGEOGRAPHIC REGION, FOLLOWED BY THE EASTERN AND THE WESTERN REGIONS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES ALSO FOLLOWS A SIMILAR TREND. ADDITIONALLY, THE INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH ANTHROPOGENIC FACTORS SUCH AS HUMAN POPULATION DENSITY AND THE NUMBER OF VISITING TOURISTS. THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT 'HIGH NATIVE DIVERSITY' SUPPORTS OR FACILITATES INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES. FURTHER, IT INDICATES THAT NATIVE AND INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES MAY REQUIRE SIMILAR NATURAL CONDITIONS, BUT THAT THE INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES SEEM MORE DEPENDENT AND INFLUENCED BY ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE FACTORS."

However, there is little information about shorebird use of the northeast coast of brazil, especially at those sites experiencing increasing levels of tourism. This study examines the potential impacts of tourism on shorebirds at atalaia nova beach in sergipe state, brazil. On a 5 km stretch of beach, we conducted censuses on 67 days throughout 2004. There was a significant negative correlation between numbers of people and numbers of all shorebirds (r = -0.25), and especially for arenaria interpres (ruddy turnstone; r = -0.24), charadrius collaris (collared plover; r = -0.31), calidris pusilla (semipalmated sandpiper; r = -0.64), and calidris canutus (red knot; r = -0.71). We conclude that the growth of tourism at atalaia nova beach (particularly recreation and development) has the potential to negatively impact shorebird use of the beach. Before tourism developments are initiated, more research should examine their potential effects on shorebird use of the area."
