However, investigations that quantify temporal changes in biodiversity in response to multiple forms of disturbance in space and time are relatively uncommon. Over a 10-yr period, we investigated the response of bird species to spatiotemporal changes in forest cover associated with logging and wildfire in the mountain ash (eucalyptus regnans) forests of southeastern australia. Specifically, we examined how bird occurrence changed with shifts in the proportion of area burned or logged in a 4.5 km radius surrounding our 88 long-term field survey sites, each measuring 1 ha in size. Overall species richness was greatest in older forest patches, but declined as the amount of fire around each site increased. At the individual species level, 31 of the 37 bird species we modeled exhibited a negative response to the amount of fire in the surrounding landscape, while one species responded positively to fire. Only nine species exhibited signs of recovery in the 6 yr of surveys following the fire. Five species were more likely to be detected as the proportion of logged forest surrounding a site increased, suggesting a possible ""concentration effect"" with displaced birds moving into unlogged areas following harvesting of adjacent areas. We also identified relationships between the coefficients of life history attributes and spatiotemporal changes in forest cover and stand age. Large-bodied birds and migratory species were associated with landscapes subject to large amounts of fire in 2009. There were associations between old growth stands and small-bodied bird species and species that were not insectivores. Our study shows that birds in mountain ash forests are strongly associated with old growth stands and exhibit complex, time-dependent, and species-specific responses to landscape disturbance. Despite logging and fire both being high-severity perturbations, no bird species exhibited similar responses to fire and logging in the landscape surrounding our sites. Thus, species responses to one kind of landscape-scale disturbance are not readily predictable based on an understanding of the responses to another kind of (albeit superficially similar) disturbance.","Spatiotemporal effects of logging and fire on tall, wet temperate eucalypt forest birds"

I island. Because this shrimp, halocaridina rubra ('opae'ula), displays a preference for autotrophic components of epilithon, we hypothesized that tree canopy would reduce their body condition and abundance, but that this would be moderated by nutrient quality of leaf litter (high-quality, non-native, nitrogen-fixing tree vs. Low-quality, endemic non-nitrogen-fixing tree). We hypothesized that poeciliid invasion would reduce population size and body condition of h. Rubra by direct predation and by inducing reductions in feeding rate. Analysis of stable isotopes (delta d, delta c-13, and delta n-15) showed that direct consumption of leaf litter detritus supplemented h. Rubra diet in ponds with canopy cover. In addition, epilithon in ponds with canopy cover was isotopically more similar to leaf litter than epilithon in ponds without canopy cover, and our evidence suggests this may be due to contributions of allochthonous nutrient sources to epilithon assemblages. However, canopy cover, whether native or invasive, did not decrease epilithon growth rates and had little effect on shrimp body condition or population size. In contrast, poeciliid invasion reduced daylight grazing on the benthos, and caused a reduction in body condition among larger shrimp. Our results indicate that primary succession by invasive trees may shift food web linkages in these ponds from autotrophic to heterotrophic support, without negative impacts on native grazer/detritivore communities. We suggest that poeciliid invasions have sub-lethal effects on h. Rubra as well as their direct predation effects, with potential long-term implications for the ecosystem function of anchialine ponds and other coastal systems.","Effects of invasion at two trophic levels on diet, body condition, and population size structure of hawaiian red shrimp"

The eemrio links economic activities from the global trade analysis project (gtap) database with land use and four indicators of biodiversity loss. We included three alpha diversity indicators (loss of mean species abundance, relative abundance and relative species richness) and one indicator of gamma diversity (vulnerability-weighted relative species richness loss). While the three alpha diversity indicators reflect local diversity within a site, the gamma diversity indicator captures global diversity by weighting regional species richness with species' extinction vulnerability in a region. We found that the three alpha diversity footprints show close alignment (r(s) > 0.93), while there was limited convergence between alpha and gamma diversity footprints (r(s) < 0.22). The alpha diversity indicators identified a diverse set of regions with high per capita consumption-based biodiversity footprints across the globe, while the gamma diversity indicator emphasized human consumption patterns threatening particularly tropical biodiversity. Although all footprints are positively related to rising household expenditure, this relationship was weaker and highly uncertain for the gamma diversity footprints. The alpha-based footprints also showed a negative relationship with population density, while the gamma-based footprint was not related to population density. Our results highlight the relevance of including both alpha and gamma diversity indicators in land-based biodiversity footprint calculations.","Consumption-Based Biodiversity Footprints - Do Different Indicators Yield Different Results?"

Sand dune communities are worldwide characterized by high levels of biodiversity, but are often affected by human-induced impacts as those caused by tourist trampling. To understand the effects of human frequentation, trampling, and other human-induced impacts, fencing experiments have been traditionally carried out on coastal dunes. Since in touristic areas dune systems are subjected to different intensities of human frequentations rather than to opening or fencing, in this study we explore the effects of accessibility on vascular plants cover. This study tests the hypothesis that human frequentation on beaches affects spatio-temporal variability of vascular plant abundance on dunes by comparing the plant assemblages of high and low accessible sites in north-east sardinia (italy). Our results show that accessibility plays a crucial role in conditioning the percentage of vegetation cover in mediterranean dunes. In fact, not only we found a perennial vegetation cover that was significantly higher in the sites with low accessibility (and consequently low frequentation), but we also showed that at the sites with high accessibility there were significant differences in vegetation cover between times of sampling (cover was higher before than after summer): on the contrary, differences in perennial vegetation cover among times were not significant at the low frequentation sites. After summer, the difference among low and high frequentation sites in species composition and cover was >90%. Multivariate analysis identified those species that play a pivotal role in differentiating the low and the high frequentation sites. Among them, crucianella maritima and sporobolus virginicus can be considered as differential species. Overall, our data show vegetation and plant species responses to human-induced impacts, and are therefore important to support conservation actions in mediterranean coastal areas interested by mass tourism.","Human trampling effects on mediterranean coastal dune plants"

Some species are tolerant or even benefit from environmental conditions such as ocean warming, acidification, and eutrophication. In consequence, increases in sponge bioerosion have been observed on some coral reefs over the last decades. The abrolhos bank is the largest coral reef system in the south atlantic. It has been affected by sedimentation, eutrophication, overfishing, and climate change, mainly affecting coastal reefs, and at lesser intensity outer ones as well. This study aimed to describe spatial and temporal patterns in bioeroding sponge distribution in carbonate substrates in the abrolhos bank. Photo-quadrats were used to compare bioeroding sponge abundance between two shallow reefs: a coastal, pedra de leste (pl), and an outer reef, parcel dos abrolhos (pab). Each individual was delimitated over the substrate by determining the sponge surface through a line connecting the outermost papillae. The study was conducted over 6 years in 2008-2009 and 2013-2016. Four species of bioeroding sponges were identified: cliona carteri ridley, 1881, c. Delitrix pang, 1973, c. Cf. Schmidtii ridley, 1881, and siphonodictyon coralliphagum rutzler, 1971. The distribution and abundance of species varied between the inner and outer reefs and across the years, and displayed certain selectivity for the calcareous substrates recorded. Crustose coralline algae (cca) were the main substrate excavated by the most abundant bioeroding species, c. Carteri, and represented 70% of the substrate types occupied by this sponge (cca, coral overgrown by cca and plain coral). The highest abundance of bioeroding sponges observed in photo-quadrats was 21.3 individuals/m(2) at the outer reefs (pab) in 2014. The abundances or areal extents of bioeroding sponges were up to 10 times greater on the outer reefs than on the coastal ones, where sedimentation is higher and more strongly influenced by siliciclastic material. Moreover, a higher herbivorous fish biomass has been reported on outer reefs which could also influence the higher abundance of bioeroding sponges in outer reefs. During the study period of 6 years, an increase in bioeroding sponge abundance was observed at the outer reefs (pab), with the sea surface temperature increase. As cca have an important role in reefal cementation and carbonate production in the abrolhos reefs, a bioerosion impact might be expected, in particular, on the outer reefs.","Long-term temporal and spatial patterns in bioeroding sponge distribution at the abrolhos bank, brazil, southwestern atlantic"

Then, the distributions of the orchids and hence likely geographic patterns of threats were mapped using 14,651 location records from the atlas of living australia. The most common threats were changes in fire regimes (74% of threatened australian orchids), invasive species (65%), habitat modification (64%), grazing (63%), tourism and recreation (47%) and illegal collection (46%), which often co-occurred as threat syndromes. Most threatened orchids are terrestrial (165 species), and many occur in temperate forests (96) and temperate shrubland (36).

Despite the large number of dams worldwide, little specific information is available on the longitudinal impacts of dams on vegetation, for example how far downstream and at what degree of regulation a dam on a river can influence riparian woodlands. 2. We quantified the long-term responses of riparian trees and shrubs to flow regulation by identifying their lateral distribution and habitat conditions along a boreal river in northern sweden that has been regulated by a single dam since 1948. The regulation has reduced annual flow fluctuations, this effect being largest at the dam, downstream from which it progressively decreases following the entrance of free-flowing tributaries. 3. We related changes in the distribution patterns, composition, abundance and richness of tree and shrub species to the degree of regulation along the river downstream from the dam. Regulation has triggered establishment of trees and shrubs closer to the channel, making it possible to measure ecological impacts of flow regulation as differences in vegetation attributes relative to the positions of tree and shrub communities established before and after regulation. 4. Trees and shrubs had migrated towards the mid-channel along the entire study reach, but the changes were largest immediately downstream of the dam. Shrubs were most impacted by flow regulation in terms of lateral movement, but the effect on trees extended furthest downstream. 5. The species composition of trees progressively returned to its pre-regulation state with distance downstream, but entrance of free-flowing tributaries and variation in channel morphology and substratum caused local deviations. Species richness after regulation increased for trees but decreased for shrubs. The changes in species composition and richness of trees and shrubs showed no clear downstream patterns, suggesting that other factors than the degree of regulation were more important in governing life form.","Responses of riparian trees and shrubs to flow regulation along a boreal stream in northern sweden"

We sampled at sites adjacent to coastal resorts, and at a distance of up to 5.7 km from resorts, in three habitat types (mixed mangrove, semi-deciduous, and coastal scrub forests). We tested for differences in abundance and richness at sites near and far from resorts and among the three habitat types. We also assessed whether bird distribution was associated with fruit abundance and/or vegetation characteristics. Across seasons, migrants were consistently more abundant at sites near resorts than at sites more distant, whereas richness of cuban residents was consistently higher at sites near resorts than at those farther away. Neither abundance nor richness of the resident guild varied significantly by habitat. The distributions of neither migrants nor residents were correlated with fruit abundance. High foliage density associated with greater edge habitat provided the strongest explanation for high estimates of abundance and richness of migrants and residents near resorts. Our results suggest that moderately disturbed forests near resorts can support abundant and rich communities of both migrants and residents.","Landbird richness and abundance in three coastal habitats near resorts in cayo coco, cuba"

We used metabarcoding of the 18s rrna gene and recovered 2313 otus, with a total of 449 otus shared between the two land-use types. The most abundant phyla detected were annelida (66.4% reads) followed by arthropods (15.5% reads) and nematodes (8.9% reads). Of these, only annelids were significantly more abundant in rubber plantation. Taken together, alpha- and beta-diversity were significantly higher in forest than rubber plantation. Soil ph and spatial distance explained a significant portion of the variability in phylogenetic community structure for both land-use types. Community assembly was primarily influenced by stochastic processes. Overall it appears that forest replacement by rubber plantation results in an overall loss and extensive replacement of soil micro- and mesofaunal biodiversity, which should be regarded as an additional aspect of the impact of forest conversion.","Tropical forest conversion to rubber plantation affects soil micro- & mesofaunal community & diversity"

Despite speculation that african elephant (loxodonta africana) browsing impacts bird communities, existing data are limited. I sampled the bird communities of the albany thicket biome at 10 sites in the eastern cape, south africa, half with elephants and half without. Songbird community parameters were best predicted by how long elephants had been present, elephant density and the percentage cover of thicket vegetation. The sites where elephants had been present for longer had more bird species and increased songbird density and diversity. However, bird density also increased with increasing thicket vegetation cover and this is a phenomenon unlikely to be compatible with long-term elephant presence. There was an almost equal split between the number of bird species that appeared to be negatively affected by changes in habitat structure (47%) and those which benefited (53%). Smaller birds were generally more abundant as vegetation structural integrity increased and larger birds were more abundant when vegetation structural integrity declined. The browsing of elephants could be viewed as facilitative for songbirds in the short term. However, this effect may not persist in the long term because all elephant populations (notorious tree-fellers) in the eastern cape are found in fenced areas where natural migration is not possible. More broadly, my data provide important insight into how avian communities respond to habitat transformation at the local and regional scales.","The elephant in the ""room': determinants of songbird assemblages in the thicket biome, south africa"

In urbanised catchments, saltmarsh areas receive nutrient-enriched and pollutant-contaminated run-off, such as heavy metals, through the stormwater system. This study aimed to investigate the impact of urban stormwater on saltmarsh and mangrove species composition and distribution. To test the effect of stormwater run-off in urbanised catchments on saltmarsh communities, we analysed the soil for pollutant elements, salinity and nutrient concentration and recorded vegetation composition at eight sites in the sydney region, australia. We found that elevated total nitrogen (> 0.4 wt%) and reduced salinity of the soil downslope of stormwater outlets facilitates establishment of exotic plants and might promote migration of mangroves into saltmarshes, resulting in a squeezing effect on the distribution of saltmarsh vegetation. Saltmarsh cover was significantly lower below stormwater outlets and exotic plant cover increased significantly with sediment calcium concentrations above 8840 mg/kg, which are associated with stormwater runoff. However, this effect was found to be strongest in highly industrialised areas compared to residential areas.

In malaysia, rice fields can be an important habitat for migrating birds due to malaysia's position on the east-asian-australasian flyway. We determined bird abundance, species richness, and composition in rice field landscapes and compared these during different stages of rice growing.

Sixty sampling points were randomly established in three locations, from which 3447 individual birds of 46 species and 26 families were recorded. There was a significant difference in total bird abundance and species richness between the three different stages of rice growing. The growing stage supported greater bird abundance and species richness compared to the pre-harvest and post-harvest stages. Rice-growing provides temporary habitats to different bird species in this managed aquatic landscape. This implies the presence of abundant food, such as small fish and amphibians.

Here we examined how road proximity and traffic intensity influence patterns of resource use in an old-world avian scavenger guild living in a protected natural park in northern spain. We experimentally placed 130 carcasses at different distances from a scenic road in the centre of the park. Vehicleswere recorded bymeans of traffic counterswhich revealed that maximumnumbers were reached during weekends and holidays and during themiddle hours of the day. Avian scavenger attendance at carcasses was recorded by means of camera-traps. Obligated scavengers, eurasian griffon (gyps fulvus) and egyptian vultures (neophron percnopterus) were frequently observed (59.4% and 37.7% of the consumed carcasses) together with five other facultative scavenger species. We found that the richness (number of species) and the probability of consumption of the resource were reduced the smaller the distance to the road and in dayswith higher traffic intensity. The same factors affected the probability of presence of all the scavenger species. Moreover, some of them, notably griffon vultures, showed hourly patterns of carcass attendance suggesting avoidance of maximum traffic levels. Our results highlight that roads and traffic would trigger consequences on the structure and functioning of scavenger food webs, which may be particularly concerning in protected areas with remarkable levels of biodiversity. Future regulations at protected areas should couple both traffic and tourist affluencewithwildlife conservation. In this way important ecological processes would be preserved while maintaining a good dissemination of natural values. (C) 2018 elsevier b.v.

Second, we explored whether these effects were context-specific across the four pas. We counted large mammals and visitor numbers along 196 road transects to test these relationships. All species-mammal diversity metrics related positively to visitor numbers. Subsets of mammal diversity were also positively associated with the distribution of visitors in all pas. Relationships between supply and demand for the recreational service of wildlife tourism were mainly context-specific: the relationships between biodiversity measures and visitor numbers differed among pas.

Although significant oiling did not occur in sjb, long-term data have been collected in this region to provide insight into population-level trends in abundance/density over time. Thus, sjb dolphins could serve as a reference for comparison to other dolphin populations exposed to dwh oiling. During 2005-2007, the results of photo id and telemetry surveys determined seasonal fluctuations in abundance and identified two different dolphin populations in sjb: residents sighted across multiple seasons and years (st.

The data collected during and post-dwh paralleled previous research in that a low number of individuals with high site fidelity were sighted across seasons and years (st.

However, this approach does not account for biological function. Trait-based analysis provides an alternative approach to bioassessment. We assessed the impact of dam closure on the functional structure of fish communities of a neotropical river by applying trait-based analyses to the response of individual traits aggregated at the assemblage level. Fish data were collected during three distinct time periods (1 year before, 1 year after and 5 years after dam closure), at eight sites located downstream of the dam, in the reservoir, transition zone and upstream. The results indicated that reproduction strategies (migration and parental care) and diet (detritivores) were the trait categories mostly affected by the dam, with the response of downstream assemblages differing from upstream of the dam. A trait-based analysis to the impact of damming on fish communities appears to be a promising approach using an initial descriptive analysis of individual traits and regression models of multiple traits that reflect species' adaptation to the new environment. This study provides both an alternative and complementary approach to taxonomic assessment of impacts from damming, contributing towards a more robust evaluation of the response of fish communities to dams.","Using a trait-based approach to measure the impact of dam closure in fish communities of a neotropical river"

We determined the distance-thresholds up to which recreation infrastructures were avoided and estimated the extent of affected habitat for the isolated black forest (southwestern germany) study population. While outdoor recreation did not affect home range selection, strong effects on habitat use within the home range were detected: distance to recreation infrastructure (hiking and cross-country skiing trails, ski pistes) was the main determinant of habitat selection in winter; in summer, mountain bike trails and hiker's restaurants were avoided up to an average distance of 145 m (ci: 60-1092 m). Around winter-infrastructure, relative avoidance was recorded up to 320 m (ci: 36-327 m), it was reduced, however, when dense understory provided visual cover. Of the entire population area, between 8-20% (summer) and 8-40% (winter) were affected by outdoor recreation, mainly in the high altitudes. Even without evident large-scale shifts in species distribution, local-scale avoidance of outdoor recreation can substantially contribute to effective habitat reduction. Based on our results we recommend a general reduction in recreation infrastructure density in key habitats, the establishment of undisturbed wildlife refuges with a diameter of at least 800 m, as well as enhancing visual protection by maintaining a strip of dense understory along trails.","Outdoor recreation causes effective habitat reduction in capercaillie tetrao urogallus: a major threat for geographically restricted populations"

A critical determinant of success in achieving these goals is the financing that is committed to maintaining biodiversity(6-9); however, financing decisions are hindered by considerable uncertainty over the likely impact of any conservation investment(6-9). For greater effectiveness, we need an evidence-based model(10-12) that shows how conservation spending quantitatively reduces the rate of biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a model, and empirically quantify how conservation investment between 1996 and 2008 reduced biodiversity loss in 109 countries (signatories to the convention on biological diversity and sustainable development goals), by a median average of 29% per country. We also show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be predicted with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances the effects of conservation investment against those of economic, agricultural and population growth (human development pressures)(13-18). Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the improvement that any proposed biodiversity budget would achieve under various scenarios of human development pressure, and then compare these forecasts to any chosen policy target. We find that the impact of spending decreases as human development pressures grow, which implies that funding may need to increase over time. The model offers a flexible tool for balancing the sustainable development goals of human development and maintaining biodiversity, by predicting the dynamic changes in conservation finance that will be needed as human development proceeds.","Reductions in global biodiversity loss predicted from conservation spending"

For coral reef organisms, refuges can be tourist resorts implementing local environment-friendly bottom-up management strategies. We used the coral reef ecosystem as a model to test whether such practices have positive effects on the biodiversity associated with de facto protected areas. Locationnorth ari atoll, maldives. Methodswe modelled the effects of the environment and three human management regimes (tourist resorts, uninhabited and local community islands) on the abundance and diversity of echinoderms and commercially important fish species, the per cent cover of reef benthic organisms (corals, calcareous coralline algae, turf and macroalgae) and the proportion of coral disease. We used multivariate techniques to assess the differences between reef components among the management regimes. Resultsreefs varied between the management regimes. A positive resort effect was found on sessile benthic organisms, with good coral cover and significantly less algae at resort islands. Corals were larger and had fewer diseases in uninhabited islands. Minor resort effect was detected on motile species represented by commercial fish and echinoderms. Main conclusionsin countries where natural biodiversity strongly sustains the tourist sector and where local populations rely on natural resources, a balance between tourism development, local extraction practices and biodiversity conservation is necessary. The presence of eco-friendly managed resorts, which practices would need to be certified on the long term, is beneficial to protect certain organisms.

We compared breeding bird species composition and abundance on 10 farm pairs of each type matched at the site level for land cover in the prairie parklands of saskatchewan, canada in 1990. Land cover was measured around bird point counts at two extents; 'site' (6.3 ha area) and 'field' (16.3 ha area). We pooled species into functional groups; linear mixed models showed no significant differences between farm types for species richness but that all birds, migratory birds using crops and aerial insectivores were more abundant on organic farms. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated that farm type did not have a significant overall effect on compositional similarity but that pairwise differences existed between about half of the farm pairs (the direction of differences in beta diversity was not consistent between organic and nonorganic fauns according to tests for the homogeneity of multivariate dispersions). Farm-pair differences were more pronounced for all birds and for migratory bird species using crops, migratory birds consuming grains and ground feeders, but not grassland birds. Nmds ordinations suggested that there was more variation in species composition and abundance on organic farms than nonorganic ones but the difference was not significant. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbitda) was used to examine the main drivers of bird species composition and abundance and to see which extent was most important; land cover at the field extent was more important than land cover at the site extent or the farming practices measured. The most important field-extent land cover was the amount of native grassland, woodland (including shelterbelts) and wetlands. After controlling for significant field-extent land cover, seed treatment, herbicide use, and number of passes were significant. At the site extent, greater non-crop heterogeneity had a significantly positive effect on abundance and species richness of several groups (e.g., grassland birds, migratory granivores, ground feeders, ground nesters) but a negative effect on richness of woodland birds and abundance of aerial insectivores. Relationships with crop heterogeneity were mostly negative and non-significant. Overall land cover heterogeneity at the site level was positively related to the richness of grassland birds. In contrast at the field extent, non-crop heterogeneity did not have any significant effects on the richness and abundance of any functional group. Crop heterogeneity had a significantly negative effect on aerial insectivore richness and abundance.

Us exports of wood pellets have grown from essentially nothing in 2008 to 4.6 million metric tons in 2015, with 99% of us pellets being shipped to europe. To examine effects of this recent expansion of the pellet industry on forest conditions, we use us department of agriculture forest service (usfs) forest inventory and analysis (fia) annual survey data for 2002-2014 to analyze changes in timberland trends since 2009 for two fuelsheds supplying pellets to the ports of chesapeake, virginia, and savannah, georgia. This analysis reveals that the chesapeake fuelshed had significant increases in acreage of large trees and harvestable carbon after 2009. Furthermore, the timberland volume within plantations increased in the chesapeake fuelshed after 2009. The savannah fuelshed had significant increases in volume, areas with large trees, and all carbon pools after 2008. Increases in carbon in live trees for the chesapeake fuelshed and all carbon pools for the savannah fuelshed for the years before and after 2009 provide empirical support to prior estimates that production of wood-based pellets in the southeast us can enhance greenhouse gas sequestration. Both fuelsheds retained more naturally regenerating stands than plantations; however the number of standing dead trees increased within naturally regenerating stands and declined within plantations (but only significantly for the savannah fuelshed). While the decrease in the number of standing dead trees per hectare for the savannah fuelshed plantations after 2009 warrants investigation into its effects on biodiversity, others have recommended thinning and hardwood mid-story control within pine plantations to provide habitat for regionally declining bird species, which is consistent with use of biomass for energy and reducing the risk of fire. While all energy use affects the environment, these results show that benefits accrue when sustainable forest management provides wood pellets for energy that keep fossil fuel in the ground. By contrast urbanization is the greatest cause of forest loss in the se us. It is essential to consistently monitor and assess forest conditions to assess changes, for exports of wood-based pellets for the southern us are expected to grow. Even though use of pellets for energy has more than doubled, the pellet industry constitutes < 1% of us forest products by weight. Therefore, any recent changes, in se us forest conditions are more likely related to the 2008 declines in the housing market.

Although a few species are imperiled as a result of the wildlife trade, the lack of field studies makes it difficult to gauge how serious a threat it is to biodiversity. We used data on changes in bird abundances across space and time and information from trapper interviews to evaluate the effects of trapping wild birds for the pet trade in sumatra, indonesia. To analyze changes in bird abundance over time, we used data gathered over 14 years of repeated bird surveys in a 900-ha forest in southern sumatra. In northern sumatra, we surveyed birds along a gradient of trapping accessibility, from the edge of roads to 5 km into the forest interior. We interviewed 49 bird trappers in northern sumatra to learn which species they targeted and how far they went into the forest to trap. We used prices from sumatran bird markets as a proxy for demand and, therefore, trapping pressure. Market price was a significant predictor of species declines over time in southern sumatra (e.g., given a market price increase of approximately $50, the log change in abundance per year decreased by 0.06 on average). This result indicates a link between the market-based pet trade and community-wide species declines. In northern sumatra, price and change in abundance were not related to remoteness (distance from the nearest road). However, based on our field surveys, high-value species were rare or absent across this region. The median maximum distance trappers went into the forest each day was 5.0 km. This suggests that trapping has depleted bird populations across our remoteness gradient. We found that less than half of sumatra's remaining forests are >5 km from a major road. Our results suggest that trapping for the pet trade threatens birds in sumatra. Given the popularity of pet birds across southeast asia, additional studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and magnitude of the threat posed by the pet trade.","Measuring the impact of the pet trade on indonesian birds"

We used elephant count data from aerial surveys for seven years in a generalized linear model, which accounted for temporal correlation, to investigate the effect of six socioeconomic and ecological variables on the number of elephant at the country level in the greater mapungubwe transfrontier conservation area (gmtfca). Important factors in predicting elephant numbers were the proportion of total land surface under cultivation, human population density and the number of tourists visiting the country. Specifically, elephant numbers were higher where the proportion of total land surface under cultivation was the lowest; where population density was the lowest and where tourist numbers had increased over the years. Our results confirm that human disturbance is affecting elephant numbers, but highlight that the benefits provided by ecotourism could help enhance elephant conservation. While future studies should include larger areas and more detailed data at the site level, we stress that the development of coordinated legislation and policies to improve land-use planning are needed to reduce the impact of increasing human populations and agriculture on elephant.","The influence of socioeconomic factors on the densities of high-value cross-border species, the african elephant"

This heavily forested region contains important breeding habitat for many neotropical migratory songbirds, including several species of conservation concern. Our goal'was to examine effects of unconventional gas development on forest habitat and breeding songbirds at a predominantly forested site from 2008 to 2015. Construction of gas well pads and infrastructure (e.g., roads, pipelines) contributed to an overall 4.5% loss in forest cover at the site, a 12.4% loss in core forest, and a 51.7%,increase in forest edge density. We evaluated the relationship between land-cover metrics and species richness within three avian guilds: forest interior, early-successional, and synanthropic, in addition to abundances of 21 focal species. Land-cover impacts were evaluated at two spatial extents: a point-level within 100-m and 500-m buffers of each avian survey station, and a landscape-level across the study area (4326 ha). Although we observed variability in species-specific responses, we found distinct trends in long-term response among the three avian guilds. Forest-interior guild richness declined at all points across the site and at points impacted within 100 m by shale gas but did not change at unimpacted points. Early-successional and synanthropic guild richness increased at all points and at impacted points. Our results suggest that shale gas development has the potential to fragment regional forests and alter avian communities, and that efforts to minimize new development in core forests will reduce negative impacts to forest dependent species.

Location: southern baltic sea beaches in germany. Methods: in this study, the species composition of vascular plants on beaches with differing accessibility to tourists was analysed at the southwest baltic sea coast. In total, 894 vegetation plots were evaluated in order to determine vegetation changes along the sea-inland gradient due to different levels of human accessibility at beaches. Releves were conducted as repeated transects from the beach ridge to the shore. Shifts in vegetation characteristics due to different levels of tourism access were analysed at the level of plant communities and plant species traits. Results: species richness did not differ significantly between the levels of accessibility. Vegetation cover significantly increased with distance to the shore and was highest in the upper shore area of closed beaches (52.0 +/- 2.7%). Corresponding to the increase in beach access, we observed an increase in ruderal species and a decrease in typical beach species of the vegetation class honckenyo-elymetea. Tourism access and distance to the shoreline had a decisive influence on the distribution of plants with selected plant traits. In particular, at accessible sites, a loss of plants with leaves having high scleromorphy was recorded. Conclusions: increased beach access results in a loss of typical beach plant species. Changes in vegetation characteristics are considered to alter the function of the beach ecosystem. Based on these results, we derived spatially differentiated management measures for excluding the most sensitive beach areas from tourism.","Beaches under pressure - effects of human access on vegetation at baltic sea beaches"

Aquaculture in the lake began decades ago, with many changes in the lake ecosystem having occurred since that time. Most dominant species for fish culture are introduced species. Other invasive species were also introduced to the lake as escapees from land-based aquaculture facilities. This study was conducted to monitor fish diversity in two adjacent, but distinctly different, sites in the lake, namely an open fishery area (ofs), with no adjacent aquaculture structures, and an aquaculture site (aqs), with cages for the culture of various commodities. Fish traps were installed at both sites, with the traps being sampled at least every 2weeks from april 2013 to february 2015. The results of pairwise t-tests indicated significantly higher shannon-wiener diversity index (h), evenness (j), simpson's similarity index (d) and species richness (s) in ofs than in aqs. In terms of total catch per day, significantly greater fish biomass were obtained from aqs than from ofs. Introduced aquaculture species had a mean dominance of 83% and 47% in aqs and ofs, respectively. However, invasive species introduced from the ornamental fish trade exhibited a mean relative dominance of 10.3% in aqs and 13.5% in ofs. The relative dominance of native species was also significantly higher in ofs (41%) than in aqs (6.5%). The results of this study demonstrated the adverse impacts of aquaculture in regard to the species diversity of fish in localized areas in laguna de bay. The dependency of aquaculture on introduced fish species adversely impacted the natural fish population in the lake. Focusing on the culture of commercially important local species for aquaculture, rather than introduced species, will improve fish production of inland waters without accompanying adverse impacts on biodiversity.","Impacts of aquaculture on fish biodiversity in the freshwater lake laguna de bay, philippines"

It is critical to monitor and assess the impacts of tourism on ecosystem health. However, there is a general lack of information on biological communities in natural reserves of developing countries and of tools for assessing human impacts. In the present study, we investigated macroinvertebrate assemblages in nine lakes in jiuzhaigou natural reserve of china. Both benthic (20 dips of d-net) and light-trap samples (2 h) were collected at each lake and all benthic specimens and adults of ephemeroptera, plecoptera, and trichoptera (ept) were identified and counted. Water temperature and water quality variables were measured on site or in the lab. Seventy taxa were recorded and dominated by dipterans and caddisflies. Light traps contributed 47% of taxa richness and 66% of ept richness at the lakes. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that water temperature and tourism index were strongly associated with the changes of assemblage composition. Taxa richness and eft richness calculated for the composite samples (benthic+light trap) were well fit with poisson generalized linear model (adjusted r-2 = 0.83 and 0.85, respectively), generally decreasing with increasing elevation, tourism index, and total-n. Tourism index was ranked as the top predictor for ept richness based on multiple model weights, and elevation for taxa richness. In comparison, when based on benthic samples, neither of the metrics could be fitted with the seven environmental variables selected.

Besides the total length of unpaved roads, we also tested: a. The site's habitat diversity, b. The coefficient of variation in habitat (patch) size, c. The distance to the nearest agricultural field, and d. The human population size of the nearest village. We measured our variables at six different distances from the bird point-count locations. We found a strong negative relationship between the total bird richness and the total length of unpaved roads. The human population size of the nearest village also had a negative effect. Habitat diversity was positively related to species richness. When the categories were tested, we found that the passage migrants were influenced more by the road network while resident breeders were influenced by habitat diversity. Species with increasing and stable populations were only marginally affected by the variables tested, but the effect of road networks on species with decreasing populations was large. We conclude that unpaved and sporadically used roads can have detrimental effects on the bird communities, especially on vulnerable species. We propose that actions are taken to limit the extent of road networks within protected areas, especially in sites designated for their rich avifauna, such as pafos forest, where several of the affected species are species of european and global importance.

The capercaillie (tetra urogallus) is an endangered umbrella species of montane forests in central europe. Despite its status, it has largely been overlooked in forest management planning in the carpathian mountains, a biodiversity hotspot within the european union. Previous investigations of timber management effects on capercaillie have shown contradictory results within europe; habitat loss and fragmentation due to intensive forest management have been implicated in population declines, while other studies have suggested neutral or positive effects. In romania, recent changes in forest management have shifted from extensive, selective logging to intensive clearcutting; this change provides the opportunity to assess the effects of harvesting on capercaillie numbers across a full range of forest management intensities, thereby addressing discrepancies in the literature. Across the southern and eastern carpathian mountains from 2009-2011, we used spring counts of capercaillie males at leks to evaluate the impact of forest management, other human activities, and habitat at two spatial scales - stand (similar to 2 ha) and landscape (similar to 300 ha). At the landscape level, the proportion of forest clearcuts and intensity of tourism had significant negative effects on the number of capercaillie males in the lek. In contrast, low intensity selective logging had a positive effect at the local stand (lek) level. Large scale (landscape level) forest clear-cutting had a negative effect on the capercaillie population - areas comprised of clearcuts of 30% reduced male lek counts by 76%. The protection of intact mature and old-growth forests, and forest management practices that emulate natural disturbance processes are recommended to support habitat of this critical umbrella species and associated biodiversity.

Shell-bearing vermetids (petaloconchus varians) and bivalves (isognomon bicolor) were more abundant at the c site, being possible bioindicators for areas with zero or little trampling. Twelve years of total closure produced near-pristine communities in the c site, dominated by zoanthids and fragile mollusks.

Conversely, plants displayed a higher fruits output per plant in deep and structured soil, in lowland areas, and in the garrigue and maquis habitats; the mean fruits output per plant increased as human trampling intensified.

We interviewed 50 coffee farmers to investigate their shade tree preferences and sources of knowledge of the properties of shade trees and coffee management practices; we also conducted tree inventories in 31 coffee farms and 10 forest sites in la sepultura biosphere reserve in chiapas, mexico. Our results showed that farmers are modifying agroforests according to their knowledge and tree preferences, and that the resulting agroforest is lower in tree diversity and dominated by pioneer and farmers' preferred tree species as compared to forests. The principal sources of knowledge of management practices are external sources, such as governmental and non-governmental organizations, whereas the primary source of tree specific knowledge is empirical knowledge. We found that the higher proportion of pioneer trees relative to forest is mostly explained by farmers' tree selection decisions (63%) rather than as a byproduct of management practices (37%) that disturb the soil and open the canopy, altering light penetration and microclimate conditions. Based on interviews and tree inventories, we found that farmers gradually replace canopy trees of neutral and disliked species by preferred species, in particular inga spp. We found that external sources continue to promote the idea that inga spp. Trees bring significant benefits to coffee production in spite of a lack of scientific evidence to support this claim.

Thus, we analysed long-term commercial fishery statistics (since 1931) and trawl sample data (since 1990) from the peipsi and vortsjarv lakes in terms of climate change and fishing pressure. Our study suggests that fisheries had direct negative effects on the size composition of the pikeperch population due to the nearly complete removal of the larger specimens. The truncation of the size-structure of the pikeperch population refers that cascading effect through the food web may occur as the abundance of inferior small fish has increased accordingly. Moreover, we found that climate changes influenced the pikeperch population in the same direction; large cohorts have become more frequent in the peipsi and vortsjarv lakes, and 0+ pikeperch are able to survive milder winters even without undergoing ontogenetic diet shifts. Consequently, overdensity of small fish have occurred, these effects might have serious implications for the economies of the poor rural communities that surround the lakes.

The huge size of the chamber is assumed to prevent significant microclimatic changes and the presence of very large boulders and cracks is assumed to offer plenty of suitable spaces, which allow invertebrates to escape local disturbance and illumination. In spite of the high vulnerability of cave organisms, disturbance of cave habitats does not necessarily result in biodiversity decrease, if the cave disturbance is limited in duration, intensity, and spatial coverage with respect to the cave size.","Weak impact of tourism activities on biodiversity in a subterranean hotspot of endemism and its implications for the conservation of cave fauna"

These ecosystems are also a magnet for tourists, who prefer these locations as leisure and holiday destinations, and such activity further increases the factors that have an adverse effect on beaches. In the study reported here the effect of human trampling on macrofauna assemblages that inhabit intertidal areas of sandy beaches was assessed using a baci design. For this purpose, three contrasting sectors of the same beach were investigated: an urban area with a high level of visitors, a protected sector with a low density of users, and a transitional area with a high level of human occupancy. The physical variables were constant over time in each sector, whereas differences were found in the intensity of human use between sectors. Density variations and changes in the taxonomic structure of the macrofauna with time were shown by permanova analysis in the urban and transitional locations whereas the protected sector remained constant throughout the study period. The amphipod bathyporeia pelagica appears sensitive to human trampling pressure and the use of this species as a bioindicator for these types of impact is recommended. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

Freshwater turtles are also host to a variety of parasites including protozoans and helminths. When introduced turtles escape, parasites may spread to native species. The objective of this study was to document the extent of platyhelminth invasions from t. S. Elegans to natural m. Leprosa populations in northern spain and southern france and to evaluate the risks that parasite host-switching may pose on indigenous freshwater turtle species. From dna barcoding analysis based on the sequencing of the cytochrome c oxidase i gene, the bayesian tree and p-distance comparisons of closely related haplotypes revealed a greater polystome richness within m. Leprosa than expected, suggesting that host switching may take place in natural environments. Because these parasites most typically infest american turtles like chrysemys picta marginata and graptemys pseudogeographica in their natural home range and because parasites were also found within t. S. Elegans feral populations, it is suggested that the red-eared slider would serve as a carrier for a variety of not strictly host-specific polystomes that are transmitted to m.

The global trade in freshwater turtles thus provides opportunity for parasites to be transported to new destinations which could impact the physiology, behavior and survival of native turtle species.","Parasite host-switching from the invasive american red-eared slider, trachemys scripta elegans, to the native mediterranean pond turtle, mauremys leprosa, in natural environments"

Guanaco density was highest in low-elevation areas with more grassland cover and little snow accumulation in winter. In low-elevation areas, guanaco density decreased with increasing livestock density. Radio-tracked guanacos exhibited a partial migration pattern: two individuals migrated seasonally, selecting grasslands and avoiding forests mainly in summer, whereas six sedentary individuals used habitats according to their availability. Migratory guanacos spent the summer in karukinka and winter on nearby ranches. High sheep densities and poor range condition on the ranches reduce key forage resources available to guanacos and may promote use of forests by guanacos, affecting forest regeneration and increasing conflict with logging. Current guanaco harvest by loggers may fail to reduce the impact of guanacos on logged-forest regeneration if guanaco spatial ecology and sheep management are not considered.

Temporal genetic analyses of samples from the ottawa (dammed) and kenogami (unregulated) river systems were used to (1) compare changes in genetic structure and diversity within and between free-flowing and regulated systems; (2) assess how impoundments have influenced the spatial and temporal genetic structure and diversity within these contrasting systems; and (3) estimate effective population sizes (n-e) in both rivers using temporal genetic estimators. Levels of genetic diversity did not differ between impounded and free-flowing rivers, nor did genetic diversity differ through time within a river system. Levels of genetic divergence over time were similarly minimal. We did, however, detect a 65% decline in effective population size in the impounded ottawa river over two generations. Moreover, over the same time period the ottawa river had substantially lower n-e estimates for lake sturgeon than the free-flowing kenogami river system.

Seasonal macrofauna collections were performed at both beaches in two different periods, one in 1999-2000 and another in 2010-2011. The physical variables did not change significantly in both beaches throughout the studied periods, however, the urban beach was subject to an increase of human pressures (tourism and shoreline modifications) over the 10-years interval considered when compared with the rural beach. The univariate community descriptors (total density, species richness and diversity) did not differ significantly among periods for the rural beach. In contrast, temporal differences were found at the most urbanised beach, principally regarding the abundances of the amphipod talitrus saltator and the isopod tylos europaeus, two of the most abundant species at both beaches. Permanova tests enhanced these temporal variations and the simper analysis attributed to these species the main differences found between periods in this beach. Since the physical environment was similar in both periods, the ecological changes were most likely attributed to the increased human pressures observed at the urban beach. Nevertheless, this study highlights the need of further robust and effective impact assessments and long-term studies to better discern between natural and human induced changes on sandy beaches.

Some locations (exuma and great guana cay) were repeatedly monitored over time. Scores ranged from ""0"" for no human impacts or invasive coastal plants to ""20"" for highly altered with dredging, coastal development and loss of native vegetation.

We used weather-surveillance radar to conduct broad regional assessments of bird response to mbhi activities within the mississippi alluvial valley and the west gulf coastal plain. Across both regions, birds responded positively to mbhi management by exhibiting greater relative bird densities within sites relative to pre-management conditions in prior years and relative to surrounding non-flooded agricultural lands. Bird density at mbhi sites was generally greatest during winter for both regions. Unusually high flooding in the years prior to implementation of the mbhi confounded detection of overall changes in remotely sensed soil wetness across sites. The magnitude of bird response at mbhi sites compared to prior years and to non-flooded agricultural lands was generally related to the surrounding landscape context: proximity to areas of high bird density, amount of forested wetlands, emergent marsh, non-flooded agriculture, or permanent open water. However, these relationships varied in strength and direction between regions and seasons, a finding which we attribute to differences in seasonal bird composition and broad regional differences in landscape configuration and composition. We detected greater increases in relative bird use at sites in closer proximity to areas of high bird density during winter in both regions. Additionally, bird density was greater during winter at sites with more emergent marsh in the surrounding landscape. Thus, bird use of managed wetlands could be maximized by enrolling lands located near areas of known bird concentration and within a mosaic of existing wetlands. Weather-radar observations provide strong evidence that mbhi sites located inland from coastal wetlands impacted by the oil spill provided wetland habitat used by a variety of birds.","Assessment of bird response to the migratory bird habitat initiative using weather-surveillance radar"

Despite this, little is known of the impacts of goose grazing on hay biomass and quality in norway. An experiment using exclosures to prevent goose grazing, and plots that were open for grazing, was established in central norway to test the effects of variable grazing intensity on dairy grassland yields. A single spring-grazing event had severe negative impact at the site with the highest grazing intensity, leading to a 25% reduction in forage yield (milk feed units per hectare) as compared to ungrazed areas. The impacts on the sites with lower grazing intensity were more subtle. The overall reduction (across all sites) of biomass yield was 26%. Forage quality, in terms of milk feed units per kg, was not much affected. Grazing increased the proportion and diversity of weeds, as evidenced by a 49% increase of the shannon biodiversity index, and there was a 1.3% decrease in the proportion of herbage biomass of sown species.

Specific changes to forest structure associated with oil and gas development included decreases in basal area and canopy cover within 20m of individual wells and with increasing well density. Of 19 species analyzed, 5 species, including ovenbird (seiurus aurocapilla), blackburnian warbler (setophaga fusca), and black-throated green warbler (setophaga virens), had lower abundance at well sites than reference sites at either the local or 25-ha scale. Six species including american robin (turdus migratorius), chestnut-sided warbler (setophaga pensylvanica), and brown-headed cowbird (molothrus ater) were more abundant at well than reference sites. Eight species did not differ in abundance between well and reference sites. All 3 songbird guilds showed distinct patterns of abundance in relation to habitat differences resulting from oil and gas development that were consistent with known fragmentation effects. Forest interior species were less abundant at well sites than reference sites and showed a declining trend with increasing well density. In contrast, the guilds of early successional species and synanthropic species were more abundant at well sites than reference sites as was species richness (alpha diversity). Avian communities differed between northern hardwood and oak forest types at reference sites but became more similar when wells were present at both scales, suggesting biotic homogenization or a loss of beta diversity occurred as similar species were attracted to well sites in both forest types. The bird communities associated with northern hardwoods and oaks still retained their unique characteristics at low well densities but became similar at high well densities suggesting a threshold somewhere between the low and high well density sites. Consequently, we recommend that if well development is to occur in extensively forested landscapes, conventional oil and gas well development be limited to a maximum of 20wells/km(2) to minimize impacts to forest birds.

Annua, whereas for native species germination in experimentally disturbed soil was either unchanged or reduced compared to undisturbed soil. Our results indicate that human activities that modify abiotic soil characteristics could play an important role in the abundance of this invasive species. If the current patterns of human activities are maintained in antarctica, the establishment success and spread of p. Annua could increase, negatively affecting native flora.","Assessing the importance of human activities for the establishment of the invasive poa annua in antarctica"

Toassess how continued use of a hiking trail coupled with changes in local climate affect a rare australian alpine plant community, we compared plant composition at different distances from a trail in 2013 during wetter conditions with that 10 years prior during a drought in 2003. In both years, only a few trampling-tolerant graminoids and cushion plants were found on the trail surface, which runs along the ridgeline. Species richness and cover in both surveys generally increased with distance from the trail, but there were differences between the windward and leeward sides of the trail. This included increased abundance of some species but continued disruption of shrub succession on the leeward side of the trail. There was an overall increase in species richness between the two surveys, and changes in the abundance of many species independent of trampling effects, possibly reflecting the more favourable/wetter conditions for plant growth in 2013. These results suggest that changes in climatic conditions can affect community composition, but that this has not negated the impact of the hiking trail on this rare community. With average temperatures increasing, and snow cover declining in the australian alps, it is likely that there will be even more changes in the windswept feldmark, including the potential colonisation of these ridges by more competitive species, such as graminoids, at the expense of the dominant shrub and some herbs that are already adversely affected by trampling. Longer term monitoring of this rare community is imperative to better understand community processes in relation to the impacts of trail use and climate change. Management options to reduce these impacts are discussed.","Sustained impacts of a hiking trail on changing windswept feldmark vegetation in the australian alps"

This study investigated the effects of tourist usage of roads vs. Hiking trails on bird communities in gorges of the flinders ranges, a popular south australian tourist destination in the arid-lands. High tourist usage along roads decreased the individual abundance and species richness of birds relative to low usage trails. The decrease in species richness, though less pronounced, also occurred at high-usage sites along trails. Changes in the species response to recreational disturbance/impacts varied depending on the ecology of the species. Bigger, more competitive birds with a generalist diet were overrepresented at high-usage sites along roads and trails. Species using microhabitats in lower vegetation layers were more sensitive. However, structural and floristic complexity of vegetation was a more important factor influencing bird abundance than tourist usage. Sites with a better developed shrub and tree layer sustained higher species abundance and richer communities. Importantly, vegetation qualities moderated the negative effect of high usage on the individual abundance of birds along roads, to the extent that such an effect was absent at sites with the best developed shrub and tree layer. To protect avifauna along recreational tracks in arid-lands gorges, we recommend the closure of some gorges or sections for vehicle or any access. Further, open space particularly for camping needs to be minimized as it creates areas of high tourist usage with modified habitat that provides birds with little buffer from disturbance.

This penchant for stylish clothing, in turn, encourages herders to increase livestock production which affects persistence of over 6 endangered large mammals in these remote, arid ecosystems. We hypothesized that global trade in cashmere has strong negative effects on native large mammals of deserts and grassland where cashmere-producing goats are raised. We used time series data, ecological snapshots of the biomass of native and domestic ungulates, and ecologically and behaviorally based fieldwork to test our hypothesis. In mongolia increases in domestic goat production were associated with a 3-fold increase in local profits for herders coexisting with endangered saiga(saiga tatarica).That increasing domestic grazing pressure carries fitness consequences was inferred on the basis of an approximately 4-fold difference in juvenile recruitment among blue sheep(pseudois nayaur)in trans-himalayan india.

This island consists of a number of important natural habitat types including creeks, mangroves, corals, and sandy, muddy, and rocky shores that accommodate diverse marine flora and fauna communities. Two rocky shores were selected at the touristic beaches being visited regularly, and further two control locations selected at pristine shores. Intertidal macroinvertebrates were collected from six microhabitats including rock platforms, cobbles, boulders, crevices, sea walls, and rock pools during two different periods representing high and low tourist seasons. Species richness, density, and assemblage structure in heavily visited shores were compared with that of control locations. Striped barnacles (balanus amphitrite) were present on platforms of all locations, thus the changes in their size were used as the obvious contrast associated with visitor's impact. A total of 70 macroinvertebrate species from 11 phyla were recorded. Significant differences were detected in taxonomic richness, density, and assemblage structure of macroinvertebrates between heavily visited and pristine shores, suggesting that macroinvertebrates were adversely affected by visitors' impact at heavily visited shores. The test of changes in species richness, density, and assemblage structure from high to low seasons yielded mixed results. The significant changes in density and assemblage structure from high to low seasons were only observed in one heavily visited shore.

Proponents of an alternative non-equilibrium paradigm argue that in variable rangeland environments, external climatic events are critical to vegetation dynamics and there is little opportunity for plantherbivore interactions to reach equilibrium. Understanding which paradigm more effectively describes an ecosystem has important consequences for management. In particular, some authors have argued that a focus on reducing stocking rates in non-equilibrium systems may be futile, and management should be opportunistic in response to unpredictable rainfall events. We measured herbaceous biomass and plant species richness and abundance at five 14-year exclosures on innamincka regional reserve. Four were situated in the dunefields land system, and one on the cooper creek floodplain. We did not detect any significant differences between grazed and ungrazed treatments in total species richness or abundance, life form richness or abundance, or herbaceous biomass. Only one species, portulaca oleracea, showed differences in abundance between treatments at more than one site, but the direction of these differences was not consistent. These results suggest that the non-equilibrium paradigm more accurately describes vegetation dynamics in the dunefields and floodplains of north-eastern south australia. It is possible that some species had been lost from the study area prior to the establishment of the exclosures, thereby precluding recovery with protection from grazing; however, a regional analysis of the flora reveals little evidence of this. We argue that the dominance of ephemeral species confers resilience by limiting the development of strong feedbacks between grazing intensity and vegetation dynamics. Current grazing practices seem consistent with the conservation of plant species diversity across the dunefields and floodplains. Future studies should focus on the impacts of cattle grazing on areas of the landscape dominated by palatable perennials, as well as the small number of rare and potentially grazing-sensitive species identified.","Arid vegetation in disequilibrium with livestock grazing: evidence from long-term exclosures"

However, original habitat at stopover sites could be affected by invasive exotic plants outcompeting native vegetation. The impact of exotic plants on the stopover behavior of migrant bird species is poorly understood. As a general hypothesis, it can be supposed that habitat change due to the presence of exotic plants will affect migrants, having a negative impact on bird abundance, on avian community assemblage, and/or on fuel deposition rate. To test these predictions, we used data obtained in august 2011 at a ringing station in a coastal wetland in northern iberia which contained both unaltered reedbeds (phragmites spp.) And areas where the reedbeds had been largely replaced by the invasive saltbush (baccharis halimifolia). Passerines associated with reedbeds during the migration period were used as model species, with a particular focus on sedge warblers (acrocephalus schoenobaenus). The saltbush promoted a noticeable change on bird assemblage, which became enriched by species typical of woodland habitats. Sedge warblers departed with a higher fuel load, showed a higher fuel deposition rate, and stayed for longer in the control zone than in the invaded zone. Invasive plants, such as saltbush, can impose radical changes on habitat, having a direct effect on the stopover strategies of migrants. The substitution of reedbeds by saltbushes in several coastal marshes in atlantic europe should be regarded as a problem with potential negative consequences for the conservation of migrant bird species associated with this habitat.","The impact of an invasive exotic bush on the stopover ecology of migrant passerines"

In recent decades, invasive plants, such as russian olive (elaeagnus angustifolia), have achieved broad distribution and local dominance in many western riparian areas, raising concerns over the loss of ecological function within these systems. In 2005 and 2006 we conducted avian point counts and surveyed vegetation cover at 95 points along the snake and columbia rivers in southeastern washington to investigate the effects of total woody vegetation cover and the relative proportion of russian olive cover on breeding and wintering riparian bird communities. Our results indicated that riparian habitats dominated by russian olive can support diverse and abundant bird communities, though cavity nesting species were noticeably sparse. Bird density and species richness were best explained by a quadratic relationship to total woody vegetation cover in both seasons, as was breeding bird community composition, with greatest density and richness in intermediate cover levels. We found no indication that the proportion of the woody vegetation comprised of russian olive strongly influenced any of these bird community metrics. Given that russian olive comprised 81.6% of the riparian vegetation in our study area, it is unclear from our results how russian olive would affect bird communities in regions where native vegetation is more abundant. Regardless, complete eradication of russian olive from riparian systems where the plant is a major component will reduce the overall habitat value for birds by eliminating significant structural complexity.","Bird community response to vegetation cover and composition in riparian habitats dominated by russian olive (elaeagnus angustifolia)"

This protected area was lightly logged in the 1970s and the park was gazetted in 1990, with multiple-use reserve sectors allocated. Since the park's inception, hunting and the trade of primates have increased, along with human migration, greater accessibility of arms, and reduction of preferred ungulate prey. Primates have declined in both the park and reserve sectors. Our data further suggest that at rds hunting has had a greater impact on primate diversity and abundance than logging. We have identified changes in species-specific vulnerability to hunting over time, with cercopithecus nictitans and lophocebus albigena initially having appeared to be relatively resistant to hunting pressure in 2002. However, subsequently as gun hunting has increased at rds, these species have become vulnerable. Although monkeys at rds have been responding behaviorally to increased gun hunting, they are not able to keep pace with changing hunting practices.

We conducted logistic regressions and used model selection to determine whether the following variables were associated with changes in the distribution of each species: presence of conspecifics at neighboring sites, distance to development (e.g., roads, buildings, and landscaped areas), proportion of vegetation cover taller than 0.75 m, elevation, distance to water, presence of both species at a site, temperature, and rainfall. Argentine ants colonized unoccupied sites from neighboring sites, but the probability of appearance and persistence decreased as distance to development, vegetation cover, and elevation increased. Winter ants appeared and persisted in sites with relatively high vegetation cover (i.e., highly shaded sites). Presence of the 2 species was negatively associated in sites with high vegetation cover (more winter ants) and sites near development (more argentine ants). Probability of colonization of argentine ants decreased where winter ants were most persistent. At sites near development within the preserve, abundant argentine ant populations may be excluding winter ants. The high abundance of argentine ants at these sites may be due to immigration from suburban areas outside the preserve, which are high-quality habitat for argentine ants. In the interior of the preserve, distance from development, low-quality habitat, and interaction with winter ants may in combination exclude argentine ants.

Fishing pressure is predominantly driven by both market access and local population density, and has a clear negative effect on the diversity and function of coral reef fishes. The strong positive effect of market access on fishing pressure makes clear the importance of understanding social-ecological linkages in the context of increasingly connected societies.

The world's largest leatherback population nests in west africa and migrates across the atlantic ocean to feed off the south american coast. There, the turtles encounter a range of fisheries, including the brazilian driftnet fishery targeting hammerhead sharks. From 2002 to 2008, 351 sea turtles were incidentally caught in 41 fishing trips and 371 sets. Leatherbacks accounted for 77.3% of the take (n = 252 turtles, capture rate = 0.1405 turtles/km of net), followed by loggerheads caretta caretta (47 individuals, capture rate = 0.0262 turtles/km of net), green turtles chelonia mydas (27 individuals, capture rate = 0.0151 turtles/km of net) and unidentified hard-shelled turtles (25 individual, capture rate = 0.0139 turtles/km of net) that fell off the net during hauling. Immediate mortality (i.e., turtles that were dead upon reaching the vessel, excluding post-release mortality) was similar among the species and accounted for 22.2 to 29.4% of turtles hauled onboard. The annual catch by this fishery ranged from 1,212 to 6,160 leatherback turtles, as estimated based on bootstrap procedures under different fishing effort scenarios in the 1990s. The present inertia in law and enforcement regarding gillnet regulations in brazil could result in the reestablishment of the driftnet fishery, driving rates of leatherback mortality to levels similar to those observed in previous decades. This development could potentially lead to the collapse of the south atlantic leatherback population, mirroring the decline of the species in the pacific. In light of these potential impacts and similar threats to other pelagic mega fauna, we recommend banning this type of fishery in the region.","Driftnet fishery threats sea turtles in the atlantic ocean"

Millipedes, anurans, insects and reptiles dominated the mortalities and mammals avoided the roads. A total of 1413 individuals belonging to 56 species were killed on roads. Nocturnal species constituted 50% of these mortalities and 64% of the species composition. There was a 299% increase in road mortalities and 648% increase in nocturnal species mortality during the festival compared to those before the festival. Mean mortalities varied across habitats and were highest in moist deciduous forests. Mortalities were influenced significantly by vehicular traffic rather than rainfall. Indications of a temporary local extinction were evident beyond certain threshold of vehicular movement. The number of vehicles plying on the roads was three times higher than the threshold level as determined in this study. The festival also had a spillover effect by causing increased mortalities on roads not connected to the temple. We discuss several strategies to minimize impacts due to large scale vehicular movement inside protected areas. (C) 2011 elsevier b.v.

Samples were taken from five paired stations located in two areas on the reef: an area protected since 2004, and an area open to tourist visits. Trampling caused important changes in the meiofaunal assemblage. The densities of the total meiofauna and of the commonest groups were negatively affected in the trampled area. Among the major groups, polychaeta proved to be very sensitive to this disturbance. The meiofauna groups showed different response patterns to trampling depending on the species of algae trampled. Reductions in animal densities were partly attributed to the loss of turf biomass and associated sand caused by trampling, and partly to the direct effect of people stepping on the animals. Considering the importance of meiofauna in the food web as well as its biodiversity, these results highlight the possible negative effects of human trampling on the ecological and economic ""services"" that coral reefs provide.","The Response Of Meiofauna To Human Trampling On Coral Reefs"

In st lucia, construction of tourism infrastructure in the coastal dry forest threatens the endangered white-breasted thrasher ramphocinclus brachyurus. Long-term protection of habitat is vital, but design of such conservation action is constrained by lack of data on the species' distribution and population responses to habitat change and fragmentation. Distance sampling surveys were conducted in 2006 and 2007 to estimate numbers and map the distribution of the two remaining sub-populations.

We propose a novel biodiversity footprint index based on bird extinction risks to evaluate the effects of global wood production and trade on biodiversity. Using 536 endangered bird species threatened by wood harvesting and logging, we calculated the ""quasi-extinction"" probabilities, that is, the probabilities that population sizes become lower than an extinction threshold after habitat loss based on initial population sizes and forest habitat loss rates. We then used bilateral wood trade data to link the biodiversity impacts in wood exporters to wood importers. We found that if recent trends in forest cover loss continue until 2100, bird species in brazil would be the most rapidly and heavily affected by wood production and trade, followed by those in indonesia; these two countries alone would account for about half of all global bird extinctions. Large-scale wood importers (i.e., china, japan, and the united states) significantly elevate overseas extinction risks and, simultaneously, reduce domestic impacts, indicating a heavy responsibility of these countries for global biodiversity loss. We also conducted a scenario analysis, which showed that the total projected number of extinct species would not decrease if each country produced the amount of wood materials necessary to meet current consumption levels. This is because bird extinction risks in tropical wood importers, such as mexico and the philippines, as well as japan and china will increase if these countries increase domestic wood production. Our biodiversity footprint index is useful to identify countries whose bird species are highly affected by wood production and trade, and to quantify the role of wood trade in bird species extinctions. Additional scenario analyses are needed to establish effective patterns of wood production and consumption for bird biodiversity conservation. (C) 2016 elsevier ltd.

We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird communities inhabiting natural savannas in the colombian flaws. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects. Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the presence of an invasive vine 'kudzu', a species introduced in some plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the llanos.

We selected these mesopredators because as semi-arboreal species they might be common nest predators, posing a serious threat to resident and migratory songbirds. Pineapple production had a pronounced positive effect on the detectability of tayras, while forest cover had a negative effect on the detection of coatis. This suggests that abundance might be elevated due to the availability of agricultural food resources and foraging activities are concentrated in forest fragments and pineapple edge habitats. Raccoon and opossum models exhibited little influence on detection from habitat covariates. Occurrence models did not suggest any significant factors influencing site use by nest predators, revealing that all four species are habitat generalists adapted to co-existing in human altered landscapes.

Some background research on the Yellow River reveals that telecoupled processes (i.e. aquaculture and oil and gas development) may have been a rationale for the channel diversion (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/YellowRiver), but I decided that this was too far removed from the actual diversion to justify inclusion in this study.
