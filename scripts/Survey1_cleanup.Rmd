# 1. Methods summary

Synthesis of survey 1 results for metacoupling/biodiversity systematic review. It consists of error checks, response summaries, numbers of papers for each stage of the PRISMA framework, and visualizations of the accepted papers.

# 2. R Setup

The script presented here was done using R (version 4.0.2; R Core Team 2020) and its packages.

Load libraries, directories, and custom functions from source file.

```{r}
# Source file
  source('./scripts/Reference.R')
```

Data is stored here:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Data directory
  dat.dir
```

Final tables are stored here:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Final tables
  tab.dir
```

Final figures are stored here:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Final figures
  fig.dir
```

For **this run** of the script, tables for manual checks will be stored in the following folder:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tab.check.dir
```

# 3. Load data

```{r}
# load previous workspace (if needed)
  #load("Survey1Results.RData")

# survey
  survey1 <- read.csv(paste0(dat.dir,'survey_cleanup\\survey1_for_cleanup.csv'))

# 5 common surveys (no changes since version 4)
  survey1.5 <- read.csv(paste0(dat.dir,
                        'common_papers\\survey1_5_common_paper_selection_090120.csv'))

# assignment sheet
  assignments <- read.csv(paste0(dat.dir,
                                 'absScreening\\Coding_MergeAssign_R1.csv'))
  
# abstract screening
  ab_screen <- read.csv(paste0(dat.dir,
                               'absScreening\\AbsScreen1_Merge.csv'))
  ab_maybes <- read.csv(paste0(dat.dir,
                               'absScreening\\AbsScreen2_maybes_to_keep.csv'))
  ab_yeses <- read.csv(paste0(dat.dir,
                              'absScreening\\final_sample_for_coding.csv'))
```

# 4. Data cleanup

## 4.1 Data preview

Merge survey 1 with the 5 common paper survey result.

```{r}
survey1 <- bind_rows(survey1,survey1.5)
```

Quick summary of the dataset. 

```{r}
# number entries
  paste('number of entries:',nrow(survey1))
  
# number columns
  paste('number of columns:',ncol(survey1))
  
# column names
  paste('column names:')
  colnames(survey1)

# number of unique papers surveyed
  paste('number of papers:',length(unique(survey1$paper_id)))
  
# number of observers
  paste('number of observers:',length(unique(survey1$coder_id)))
  
# list of observers
  paste('observer names:')
  paste(unique(survey1$coder_id),collapse="; ")
```

The expected number of papers surveyed should be **593** (plus or minus 2 with duplicated study IDs 379 and 501).

## 4.2 Editing each column

First, we change the the paper ID numbers in the assignment sheet for those with duplicate IDs that have been changed in the surveys.

```{r}
# change paper ID based on original ID and coder
  assignments$STUDY_ID.1[assignments$STUDY_ID.1==501 &
                           assignments$REVIEWERS=='EmilyX'] <-5010002
  assignments$STUDY_ID.1[assignments$STUDY_ID.1==501 &
                           assignments$REVIEWERS=='Yuqian'] <- 5010001
  assignments$STUDY_ID.1[assignments$STUDY_ID.1==379 &
                           assignments$REVIEWERS=='Ruishan'] <- 3790002
  
  write.csv(assignments,paste0(dat.dir,'assignments_fixed.csv'),row.names=FALSE)
```

### 4.2.1 Publication years

There are some typos in publication years. The publication years for each paper ID will thus be replaced with those from the assignment sheet.

```{r}
# get list of values to replace
  pID <- unique(survey1$paper_id)

# replace years
  for (i in 1:length(pID)){
      survey1$year_pub[survey1$paper_id==pID[[i]]] <-
      assignments$PY[assignments$STUDY_ID.1==pID[[i]]]
  }
```

## 4.2.2 Author names

Some author names have also been recorded incorrectly. Here, we copy the author list from the assignment sheet to replace all the author entries in the survey.

```{r}
# change to character
  assignments$AU <- as.character(assignments$AU)
  survey1$author <- as.character(survey1$author)

# replace author names
  for (i in 1:length(pID)){
      aut <- str_split(assignments$AU[assignments$STUDY_ID.1==pID[[i]]],";")[[1]][1]
      survey1$author[survey1$paper_id==pID[[i]]] <- aut
  }
```

### 4.2.3 Criteria 1 (Accepted papers only)

For this column and all subsequent columns, we only need to focus our edits on the accepted papers.

```{r}
# drop rejects
  keep <-  subset(survey1, status=='accept')

# antijoin for rejects (to be combined later)
  reject <- anti_join(survey1,keep)
```

Get unique values across columns

```{r}
# drop levels
  keep <- droplevels(keep)

# unique criteria 1s
  #unique(keep$C1_biodiv)
  length(unique(keep$C1_biodiv))
```

These are **too unique to clean up**. Perhaps better results can be taken from survey2. This is a problem with open-ended questions.


### 4.2.4 Criteria 2 (Accepted papers only)

Get unique values across columns

```{r}
# unique criteria 2s
  #unique(keep$C2_meta)
  length(unique(keep$C2_meta))
```

Again, **too unique to clean up**. 

### 4.2.5 Criteria 3 (Accepted papers only)

Get unique values across columns

```{r}
# unique criteria 3s
  #unique(keep$C3_quant)
  length(unique(keep$C3_quant))
```

Again, **too unique to clean up**. Reserve for now.

### 4.2.6 Criteria 4 (Accepted papers only)

Get unique values across columns

```{r}
# unique criteria 4s
  keep$C4_study <- as.factor(keep$C4_study)
  levels(keep$C4_study)
  length(unique(keep$C4_study))
```

Show the entries for each of these study types and correct as needed.

```{r}
# "Experimental study" 
  keep[keep$C4_study==levels(keep$C4_study)[1],]
```

```{r}
# "Interview" 
  keep[keep$C4_study==levels(keep$C4_study)[2],]
```

```{r}
# Edit as per email with coder 
  keep$C4_study[keep$paper_id==5853] <- "Observational study"
```

"The estimation of gecko abundance is based on the combination of observational and survey data. I think it is sufficiently robust, and this paper met all the other criteria we established. So I would include this paper in the dataset and recode the study type as "observational" (because it has at least the observational component)"

```{r}
# "Mixed: both observational/experimental study and literature review" 
  keep[keep$C4_study==levels(keep$C4_study)[3],]
```

```{r}
# Edit as per email with coder 
  keep$C4_study[keep$paper_id==425] <- "Observational study"
```

```{r}
# "Modeling study (using empirical data and not projected)" 
  keep[keep$C4_study==levels(keep$C4_study)[4],]
```

```{r}
# "Observational study" 
  keep[keep$C4_study==levels(keep$C4_study)[5],]
```

```{r}
# "Observational/Modeling study"
  keep[keep$C4_study==levels(keep$C4_study)[6],]
```

This paper will remain, as per email with MG_Chung:
"I also remembered this ID 45 paper. I first thought that this paper is modeling paper as their method section in the main text. But we discussed this paper together, then we noticed that its supplementary information provided their specific data based on previous observational data. So, I selected both observational and modeling study and moved to the survey 2 and 3. In my opinion, we could not select this paper one of observational or modeling study. It is mixed."


Drop levels

```{r}
# drop levels
  keep$C4_study <- droplevels(keep$C4_study)
```


### 4.2.7 Explicit telecoupling impacts on biodiversity (Accepted papers only)

This question informs us about the number of papers from which the telecouplings are inferred or if they are explicitly stated.

We first assess how many are missing this answer, as this question was added at a later point in time in the review process.

### 5.1.1 Visualizing accepted papers over time

Visualizing accepted papers over time, including the ones from the abstract screening process.

```{r}

### 5.1.2 Acceptance rate at each level of review

Acceptance rate for abstract screening.

```{r}
# get total abstract acceptance rate
  sum(ab_all$INCLUDE=='YES')/nrow(ab_all)
```

Acceptance rate for papers that were reviewed (**NOTE:** this includes the 5 common surveys).

```{r}
# get total paper acceptance rate
  sum(survey1$status=='accept')/nrow(survey1)
```

Acceptance rate per person (**NOTE:** this excludes the 5 common surveys per person, but has a rate for it on its own as "all").

```{r}
# get summary
  acr <- ddply(survey1, .(coder_id), summarize,
              # total count of entries     
              count=length(coder_id),
              accept=sum(status=='accept'),
              reject=sum(status=='reject'),
              # percent acceptance
              accept_rate=sum(status=='accept')/length(coder_id))
  acr
``` 

Average per-person acceptance rates

```{r}
# mean per-person acceptance rate 
  mean(acr$accept_rate)
```

## 5.2 Themes across accepted papers

Add abstracts to the accepted papers and convert to term matrix.

```{r}
# fix columns
  assignments$ABSTRACT <- as.character(assignments$ABSTRACT)
  keep$abstract <- NA
  assignments$TITLE <- as.character(assignments$TITLE)
  keep$title <- NA

# get list of values to replace
  pID <- unique(keep$paper_id)

# add abstracts
  for (i in 1:length(pID)){
      keep$abstract[keep$paper_id==pID[[i]]] <-
      assignments$ABSTRACT[assignments$STUDY_ID.1==pID[[i]]]
  }
  
# add title
  for (i in 1:length(pID)){
      keep$title[keep$paper_id==pID[[i]]] <-
      assignments$TITLE[assignments$STUDY_ID.1==pID[[i]]]
  }
  
# make into table, save and re-read
  ab_table  <- subset(keep, select=c("title","abstract"))
  write.table(ab_table, paste0(tab.dir,"s1_accepted_abstracts.txt"), sep=" ")
  ab_table <- VCorpus(VectorSource(readLines(paste0(tab.dir,
                                                    "s1_accepted_abstracts.txt"))))
  
# transform special characters into a space
  toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern," ",x))
  ab_table <- tm_map(ab_table, toSpace, "/")
  ab_table  <- tm_map(ab_table, toSpace, "@")
  ab_table  <- tm_map(ab_table, toSpace, "\\|")
  ab_table  <- tm_map(ab_table, toSpace, "\t")
  ab_table  <- tm_map(ab_table, toSpace, ",")
  ab_table  <- tm_map(ab_table, toSpace, ";")
  ab_table  <- tm_map(ab_table, toSpace, "_")

# cleanup
  ab_table <- tm_map(ab_table, content_transformer(tolower))
  ab_table <- tm_map(ab_table, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
  ab_table <- tm_map(ab_table, removeWords,
                     c('however','per','also','may', 'elsevier', 'can'))
  ab_table  <- tm_map(ab_table, toSpace, "-")
  ab_table <- tm_map(ab_table, removeNumbers)
  ab_table <- tm_map(ab_table, removePunctuation)
  ab_table <- tm_map(ab_table, stripWhitespace)
  
# Create term matrix
  term.mtrx <- TermDocumentMatrix(ab_table)
  mtrx <- as.matrix(term.mtrx)
  rows.mtrx <- sort(rowSums(mtrx),decreasing=TRUE)
  abterms.df <- data.frame(word = names(rows.mtrx),freq=rows.mtrx)

# Show frequency of the top 20 terms
  head(abterms.df, 20)
```

### 5.2.1 Wordcloud 

Next, make a wordcloud.

```{r wordcloud, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Word cloud
  png(paste0(fig.dir,"S1_word_cloud.png"),
      height=6,width=6,units='in',res=300)
  par(mar = rep(0, 4))
  
  set.seed(1234)
  wordcloud(words = abterms.df$word, freq = abterms.df$freq, min.freq = 10,
            max.words=100, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.0, 
            colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
  dev.off()
```

## 5.3 Counts of study types (accepted papers only)

```{r}
# get summary
  ddply(keep, .(C4_study), summarize,
        # total count of entries     
        count=length(C4_study),
        percent=length(C4_study)/nrow(keep))
```

## 5.4 Counts of papers that were inferred (accepted papers only)

Total rate of **inferring** across papers.

```{r}
# get total papers for which the tc relationships were inferred
  paste('number inferred papers:',sum(keep$explicit_distant_impacts=='No'))
  paste('number explicit papers:',sum(keep$explicit_distant_impacts=='Yes'))
  
# get total inferring rate
  paste('inferred percent:',sum(keep$explicit_distant_impacts=='No')/nrow(keep))
  paste('explicit percent:',sum(keep$explicit_distant_impacts=='Yes')/nrow(keep))
```

Percent of papers inferred per person per person

```{r}
# get summary
  ddply(keep, .(coder_id), summarize,
        # total count of entries     
        count=length(coder_id),
        inferred=sum(explicit_distant_impacts=='No'),
        explicit=sum(explicit_distant_impacts=='Yes'),
        # percent inferred
        inferred_rate=sum(explicit_distant_impacts=='No')/length(coder_id))
```

# 6. Cleaned survey export

```{r}
# join tables
  survey1 <- bind_rows(keep,reject)

# export
  write.csv(survey1,paste0(dat.dir,'survey1_cleaned.csv'),row.names=FALSE)

```
